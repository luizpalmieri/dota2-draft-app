      "To increase your farm efficiency/speed, consider using Waveform to last hit creeps in one jungle camp while traveling to the next one.",
      "You're invulnerable during Waveform. You can use this to run head first into spell projectiles like Gyrocopter's Homing Missile to absorb the stun or just dodge any other damage instances while Waveforming.",
      "You can toggle Attribute Shift while channeling a TP.",
      "Always try to max STR Attribute Shift before picking up a Shield rune since the barrier scales off your HP.",
      "When you're low, Attribute Shifting into full AGI and then shifting back to STR will generate HP out of thin air.Why? Well I know you come to these tips because you don't want to read a lot of things, but if youarewilling to spend a little more brain power learning about Dota, I highly recommend studying the following post explaining howHP gain from Attribute Shift can be properly exploited.",

      "Mechanics on Morphs:Morphs copy the currentpercentageof HP/Mana on Morphling when cast.Morphs will keep Morphling's items and you can use them normally as the Morphed hero.Morphs only take the target's attack range and move speed as stats. You do not take the target's attributes, level, base armor, base damage, BAT, or projectile speed.Morphling benefits from most innates and facets of the targeted hero, but not talents.The Agh's Scepter Morph illusiondoesreceive the targeted hero's talents.If you Morph into a hero with a new spell granted by Agh's Scepter/Shard, you'll only get it if Morphling has a Scepter/Shardandthe enemy has their Scepter/Shard.If you Morph into a hero whose non-ultimate spell gets upgraded by Agh's Scepter/Shard, only Morphling needs the Scepter/Shard to get the upgrade.If you create an alt-cast Agh's Scepter Morph illusion of an enemy, the illusion will copy whatever Scepter/Shard status the enemy hero has. However, the illusion won't be able to cast new spells granted by Scepter, only ones granted by Shard. If you read this tip and it makes sense to you, you just earned your Dota PhD.Toggling out of a Morph behaves the same way as Rubick's Spell Steal timing out in terms of buffs/spells/summons lingering.Toggling into an Agh's Scepter Morph illusion effectively 'kills' the illusion and only makes you take its position and copy its cooldowns.Morphs spawn with a full set of charges for any charge based spell.If your target hero gets 'new spells' or levels up their own spells, you can refresh your Morph's spells by toggling in and out of the Morph. This is mainly relevant if you Morph an Invoker since you can get new Invoker spells whenever he Invokes them.When targeting an enemy illusion with Morph, your cast will target and turn into the owner/source of the illusion, not necessarily the hero itself.Activating a Manta Style or illusion rune as another hero will generate illusions of that hero and keep them even after morphing back.If you die in Vengeful Spirit's form while you have an Agh's Scepter, you will turn into a Vengeance Aura Venge illusion when you die. You'll also take that illusion's place when you respawn as Morphling.Because the Agh's Scepter Morph illusion can cast spells, it can also channel Watchers and Outposts.If you turn into Huskar, you'll lose all your mana thanks to his Blood Magic innate.If you generate self-illusions using Naga Siren's Mirror Image or Shadow Demon's Disruption, you can shift+queue Morph (or just hit the hotkey) after casting those spells to create Morphling illusions.You can activate Sand Storm as Sand King and then Morph out but still keep the Sand Storm buff as long as you remain in the AoE.Activating Terrorblade's Metamorphosis while Morphedonly affects your Morph as Terrorblade.Toggling back to Morphling will remove the Metamorphosis buff and it'll be on cooldown whenever you toggle back into Terrorblade.",

      "Morphling cannot Waveform when rooted.",
      "If Morphling has taken the green \"Ebb\" facet, Adaptive Strike doesn't stun. It only stuns if he has the red \"Flow\" facet.",
      "You need to have quick nuke damage if you want to kill Morphling. With STR Attribute Shift, he can usually gain HP faster than you can burn him down with auto attacks or DoTs.",
      "The HP regen Morphling gains from STR Attribute Shifting can be reduced by debuffs that affect Health Restoration:Items that can reduce health restoration: Spirit Vessel, Orb of Frost/Corrosion, Skadi, Shiva's Guard, and the \"Crippling Crossbow\" and \"Jidi Pollen Bag\" neutral item artifacts.Spells that can reduce health restoration: Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast, Broodmother's Spin Webs with \"Necrotic Webs\" facet, Doom's Doom, Dragon Knight's \"Frost Dragon\" facet, Drow Ranger's Agh's Scepter Hypothermia, anda few others.",

      "Silences, stuns, taunts, fears, and hexes are all good ways to prevent Morphling from starting to Attribute Shift. They also prevent him from being able to un-Morph himself if he's cosplaying another hero.",
      "You can click on an enemy Morphling and see his current AGI/STR Attribute Shift ratio. The longer a fight goes, the likelier it is that he's had to shift more STR to survive.",
      "You may be your own hero's worst nightmare. For example: You know what Ember Spirits love doing? Rooting people and dealing magic damage. You know what Ember Spirits hate? Being rooted from Searing Chains and not being able to deal magic damage through Flame Guard. Know how to deal with your own spells in case Morphling Morph's into you or your teammates.",
      "You can see how much time Morphling has left in a Morph by clicking it and checking the buff timer.",
      "Elder Titan can be annoying for Morphling to deal with. A big reason why Morphling can feel so tanky is because he gets so much armor from his AGI. ET basically bypasses all of that with Natural Order's main armor reduction.",
      "Drow Ranger has a lot of tools to deal with Morphling. Marksmanship ignores main armor (base armor + AGI armor), Gust silence can catch a Morphling off guard before he gets Attribute Shift off, and her Agh's Scepter \"Hypothermia\" on Frost Arrows reduces HP gain from Attribute Shift."
