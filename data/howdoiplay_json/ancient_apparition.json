      "Ice Vortex is more than a massive range slow. Throw them all over the place when you're pushing or defending to reduce enemy magic resistance. Keep this in mind when attacking people with Chilling Touch's magical damage as well.",
      "Ice Vortex is a great scouting tool with the vision it provides. Use it to scout out Rosh attempts or to check high ground or to help with counterwarding.",
      "Ice Vortex is a great spell to use to stack camps because of its ludicrous range and cheap mana cost.",
      "Manually casting Chilling Touch on enemy heroes won't draw creep aggro.",
      "Ice Blast is a great way to disable enemy Blink Daggers for an extended period of time. You don't even need to land the Blast, as long as they get the Frostbitten DoT debuff an enemy's Dagger will stay broken for the whole duration.",
      "Shoot your ult further than you think it should go in most short range encounters. The Shatter debuff can be more useful than the nuke in some situations and as long as an enemy is along the path of the projectile, they'll get Frostbitten. Plus, the Ice Blast projectile travels slow as hell at low ranges and it's very easy for people to outrun it the second they see it."

      "His ult is famous for having Dota 2's most complicated tooltip. If you're against an AA, all you need to know is that if his ult flew over your head, you have a debuff that won't let you heal any HP. No lifesteal, no fountain regen, no Tranquil Boots, no Urn of Shadows, no Omniknight PYOORIFICAYSHUN. Just you sitting and praying that you don't drop below the Shattering threshold.The exceptions to the no-HP regen under Ice Blast rule are: Lone Druid's True Form (with the Bear with Me facet), Terrorblade's Sunder, Undying's Decay, and Weaver's Time Lapse.The \"Essence Ring\" neutral item artifact will give you bonus HP on activation even under Ice Blast.",

      "The \"Essence Ring\" neutral item artifact will give you bonus HP on activation even under Ice Blast.",
      "If you're walking back to the fountain at low HP and an enemy AA is alive, take a short break and try to bait the Ice Blast. It's worth spending a few extra seconds standing somewhere else in your base rather than risking getting Blasted in your fountain.If you're too impatient to wait, you can go into your fountain and buy a cheeky Raindrop. If the Blast lands, it may save you, if it doesn't, sell it back. Buying Cloak could also work, you'll just turn a bunch of gold unreliable when you sell it back.",
