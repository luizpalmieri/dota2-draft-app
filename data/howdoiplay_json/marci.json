      "You can cast Dispose on an ally's top bar portrait to easily target them. Useful if you're trying to save a specific target in a sea of summons or illusions in a chaotic team fight.",
      "If an ally or enemy is affected byforced movement or knockbackwhile flying in Dispose, they'll immediately drop to the ground and slow the AoE underneath them.",
      "You can't Dispose units affected by Enigma's Black Hole or Faceless Void's Chronosphere.",
      "You can use Dispose to cancel an enemy's channel because the throw counts as a stun.Dispose will also cancel ally channels.",
      "Dispose will also cancel ally channels.",
      "Dispose throw distance is slightly affected by the z-axis of the map. If you throw a unit uphill, they may not go as far, and if you throw a unit downhill, they'll go slightly further than a ground level Dispose.",
      "When farming lanes, ranged creeps are your best friends. If you have the mana, Rebound off your ranged creep into the enemy wave, then chuck the enemy ranged in with Dispose to quickly nuke a wave down.",
      "Dispose destroys trees wherever the target unit lands.",
      "Rebound destroys trees wherever you land.",
      "Your Rebound landing location is not perfectly in the center of the target AoE, but instead slightly closer to the direction you leapt from. Ideally, if you're trying to Dispose an enemy into your team after Rebounding, you may want to catch the enemy with the edge of the Rebound AoE so you have a good Dispose angle immediately after landing.",
      "Respect the z-axis when casting Rebound. If your Rebound trajectory arcs over a cliff, you may end up landing on the cliff instead of your targeted AoE.",
      "Always be on the lookout for allies to Rebound off of when you're trying to escape.",
      "Agh's Shard Rebound allows you to jump off neutral creeps in addition to enemies.",
      "You can pop an enemy Linken's Sphere by targeting Agh's Shard Rebound on them.",
      "Even if the targeted unit you're Rebounding to dies mid-dash, you'll still leap off their corpse. Very metal.",
      "Be aware that targets can disjoint Rebound's initial dash. You'll run to wherever they were before they disjointed your Rebound and then suddenly stop. So warn allies if they're thinking about blinking or activating a Manta Style before you bounce off them.",
      "Rebound's initial dash is stopped by Disruptor's Kinetic Field, but the leap can get you out.",
      "Bodyguard can be cast oncreep-heroeslike Lone Druid's Spirit Bear, Visage's Familiars, or Warlock's Golem.",
      "Mechanically, think of the counter attacks from Bodyguard as being similar to Legion Commander's Moment of Courage attacks. They are attacks that can proc items and apply debuffs. However, if your hero is unable to attack, like from being disarmed or stunned, you will not issue any counter attacks.Bodyguard counter attacks proc if your Bodyguarded ally attacks an enemy within your counter attack AoEorit'll proc on enemies who are attacking your Bodyguarded ally within your AoE.Bodyguard counter attacks will reduce Unleash's strike counter.Bodyguard counter attacks can proc while you're waiting in-between Unleash combos.There is an internal cooldown on Bodyguard counter attacks. You can't deal 5 attacks in one second no matter how many quickly your Bodyguarded target attacks or gets attacked.",
      "Bodyguard counter attacks proc if your Bodyguarded ally attacks an enemy within your counter attack AoEorit'll proc on enemies who are attacking your Bodyguarded ally within your AoE.",
      "Bodyguard counter attacks will reduce Unleash's strike counter.",

      "There is an internal cooldown on Bodyguard counter attacks. You can't deal 5 attacks in one second no matter how many quickly your Bodyguarded target attacks or gets attacked.",
      "Enemies cannot see Unleash pulses if your hero is in fog.",
      "You can continue Unleash combos and get pulses on deny attacks.This is extremely situational, but in theory you could plant a ward and immediately deny combo it to get a pulse. Potentially useful against ethereal, invisible, or fogged units or to maybe cancel a Blink Dagger.",
      "This is extremely situational, but in theory you could plant a ward and immediately deny combo it to get a pulse. Potentially useful against ethereal, invisible, or fogged units or to maybe cancel a Blink Dagger.",
      "Agh's Scepter Unleash allows Marci's abilities to create pulses when Unleash is active.Dispose releases a pulse at the target's location upon landing.Rebound releases a pulse at Marci's location upon landing.Bodyguard releases a pulse at Marci's and the ally's location on cast.Special Delivery releases a pulse at Marci's location.",
      "Dispose releases a pulse at the target's location upon landing.",
      "Rebound releases a pulse at Marci's location upon landing.",
      "Bodyguard releases a pulse at Marci's and the ally's location on cast.",
      "Special Delivery releases a pulse at Marci's location.",
      "When taking the \"Unleash Duration Extended on Kill\" talent, you don't actually have to get the killing blowwith Unleash. As long as the Unleash debuff is applied on the enemy when they die, you'll get the duration extension even if Marci kills them with another spell or item."

    "counter_tips": [
      "Be aware that enemy couriers will be harder to kill thanks to Marci's Special Delivery innate.",
      "Respect Dispose in lane. Marcis are always fishing for opportunities to yeet you into their tower.",
      "Rebound takes some time to cast and the stun radius isn't that large. In lane, don't just mindlessly walk in one direction if you're expecting a Marci to Rebound on you. Dodge it like you would a Leshrac Split Earth or a Lina Light Strike Array.",
      "Roots/leashes prevent Marci from casting Rebound.",
      "The only thing that can cancel a Reboundthat's already mid-castare sources offorced movement or knockback. Otherwise, she'll receive whatever stun/root/silence/taunt you put on her, but continue dashing and leaping.",
      "Ghost Scepter and banishes can be useful at wasting her time while she's Unleashed."
