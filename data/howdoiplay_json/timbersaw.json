      "Timbersaw's Exposure Therapy innate gives him mana for every tree he kills.",
      "Whirling Death can be activated while you're mid-Timber Chain.",
      "Be generous when targeting Timber Chain. It's okay to sacrifice ~50 range to ensure you aren't whiffing Chains.",
      "Timber Chain gives a very small slice of vision as it travels and gives 400 ground vision for a split second once it reaches max distance. You can use this to quickly scout inside the Rosh pit if you don't want to spend Chakram for vision.",
      "If you Eul's yourself after casting Timber Chain, you'll fly up and the cyclone will get canceled once the Chain hits a tree. Use this to dodge enemies who may try to cancel your Chain cast with stuns.",
      "Using Blink Dagger immediately after casting Timber Chain allows you to change your angle of approach to a targeted tree. You can use this to get Chain damage on an enemy and still quickly return to safety. You can also toss a Chain, blink into a creep wave and Whirling Death, and promptly fly out.",
      "If you and your lane partner have amazing communication, you may be able to catch enemies off guard by having an ally plant an Iron Branch right on top of an enemy to give you a surprise Timber Chain target.",
      "You can cast Chakram before Timber Chain connects or during the travel time to cut down on the Chakram cast animation. Timber will start the animation for Chakram as soon as he's in range of wherever you targeted it. Shift+queueing Chakram after casting Chain is the guaranteed fastest way to do this.",
      "Remember that you can draw aggro from creeps on demand by right clicking enemy heroes. Even if the enemy hero is across the map, right clicking them will draw creep aggro to help build Reactive Armor stacks.You can even use the top bar portraits to draw aggro. If you see an enemy hero is in vision on your minimap, you can attack+move (default A+left click) the enemy top bar portrait and it'll issue an attack command which'll draw creep aggro without having to move your camera.",
      "You can even use the top bar portraits to draw aggro. If you see an enemy hero is in vision on your minimap, you can attack+move (default A+left click) the enemy top bar portrait and it'll issue an attack command which'll draw creep aggro without having to move your camera.",
      "Go into the jungle and tank a few neutrals to build up Reactive Armor stacks before a gank/dive.",
      "The Agh's Scepter Reactive Armor active can be dispelled by enemies, but you'll deal the explosion damage when the buff is removed.",
      "An enemy can receive the burst damage from the Chakram once when it flies out and once when it's coming back. So if it looks like an enemy is about to escape the AoE of the Chakram, just return it while they're still in it. The extra passthrough damage will be more useful than a few more milliseconds of slow.",
      "The lower an enemy's HP, the greater the Chakram slow will be.",
      "Timbersaw is disarmed when a Chakram is out.",
      "If you're trying to prevent someone from Blinking out when they're exiting a banish or Eul's or respawning from Aegis, don't expect a stationary Chakram to reliably cancel their Dagger. A Chakram in place only deals damage during set intervals. However, amovingChakram checks for units to damage every tick that it's traveling. So time your Chakram cast/return so that it's moving underneath the enemy when they appear.",
      "Learn the trees on the map. There are many unique juke paths that only Timber can take advantage of thanks to his skill set.",
      "When escaping late game, try carving out paths with Chakram before Timber Chaining. Timber Chaining into a deforested area could buy you a few seconds of fog.",
      "The \"Twisted Chakram\" facet always travels to Timbersaw's left first as it goes through its infinity \u221e path.",
      "Agh's Shard Flamethrower can damage buildings.",
      "Agh's Shard Flamethrower sets trees on fire as well. They will be destroyed after burning for 5 seconds."

    "counter_tips": [
      "Don't stand next to trees when laning against or escaping from a Timbersaw. The distance you're saving by hugging the treeline won't matter when he purely damages your ass.",
      "In lane, consider constantly cutting down trees if you have a Quelling Blade. You'll give Timbersaw fewer angles to Chain off of or fewer trees to get Whirling Death damage off of.",
      "Timbersaw hates being silenced, especially if he has a Chakram out because that means he literally can't do anything. He can't attack because Chakram disarms him, and he can't return the Chakram because he's silenced.",
      "Timbersaw cannot Timber Chain when rooted or leashed.Or more accurately, he can'tcastTimber Chain. If he's already shot his Chain projectile, it'll still pull him even if he's rooted.",
      "Or more accurately, he can'tcastTimber Chain. If he's already shot his Chain projectile, it'll still pull him even if he's rooted.",
      "If you stun Timbersaw at any point after the Chain projectile comes out, he'll stop moving. If your team has a shortage of stuns, save them for when you see his Chain come out as opposed to preventing him from casting the spell at all. That way his Chain goes on cooldown, but he won't go anywhere.",
      "If you have an Iron Branch in lane and wanna go for big plays, you can tryplanting a treeright in front of Timber when he'strying to escapeand intercept his Timber Chain cast. Other players besides Arteezy probably do this, but no one cares when they do it.",
      "BreakingTimbersaw will stop him from gaining new Reactive Armor stacks, but existing stacks will remain.",
      "The HP regen Timbersaw gains from his Reactive Armor passive can be reduced by debuffs that affect Health Restoration:Items that can reduce health restoration: Spirit Vessel, Orb of Frost/Corrosion, Skadi, Shiva's Guard, and the \"Crippling Crossbow\" and \"Jidi Pollen Bag\" neutral item artifacts.Spells that can reduce health restoration: Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast, Broodmother's Spin Webs with \"Necrotic Webs\" facet, Doom's Doom, Dragon Knight's \"Frost Dragon\" facet, Drow Ranger's Agh's Scepter Hypothermia, anda few others.",
      "Items that can reduce health restoration: Spirit Vessel, Orb of Frost/Corrosion, Skadi, Shiva's Guard, and the \"Crippling Crossbow\" and \"Jidi Pollen Bag\" neutral item artifacts.",
      "Spells that can reduce health restoration: Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast, Broodmother's Spin Webs with \"Necrotic Webs\" facet, Doom's Doom, Dragon Knight's \"Frost Dragon\" facet, Drow Ranger's Agh's Scepter Hypothermia, anda few others.",
      "Chakram has a fairly slow travel time, so it's usually worth sacrificing some positioning if it means you can sidestep the saw when he's chasing you.",
      "Be mindful when right click harassing him in lane. Often times, Timber's prefer the Reactive stacks. Ideally you want to harass him with magic damage exclusively, if possible.",
      "If you're a strength hero, Whirling Death's primary attribute loss debuff will make you extremely vulnerable in lane.",
      "You can remove the Agh's Scepter Reactive Armor barrier with basic dispels, but Timbersaw will explode the moment it's dispelled."
