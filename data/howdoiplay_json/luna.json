      "The Lunar Blessing innate damage aura works on creep-hero units like Brewmaster's Primal Split Brewlings, Lone Druid's Spirit Bear, Visage's Familiars, or Warlock's Golem.",
      "The Lunar Blessing innate gives you bonus night vision. If you see an enemy at night just at the edge of your vision, there's a good chance they can't see you yet.",
      "Lunar Orbit can damage invisible enemies that are in the AoE.",
      "Bounces from Moon Glaives don't actually behave as right clicks, but rather as a passive spell. As a result, the Glaives will ignore evasion and won't proc on-hit effects like Centaur Warrunner's Retaliate.However,unlike other spells, spell damage amp or spell lifesteal doesn't work on Glaives and Glaives are reduced by damage block.",
      "Eclipse is married to Lucent Beam. If for some reason you're keeping Lucent Beam at low levels, Eclipse is going to do less damage.",
      "Eclipse doesn't continue after you die, so don't use it if you're getting ganked just because you're angry that you got caught.Agh's Scepter Eclipse (ground or self targeted) ends prematurely if Luna dies. When cast on an ally, it ends prematurely if that ally dies.",
      "Agh's Scepter Eclipse (ground or self targeted) ends prematurely if Luna dies. When cast on an ally, it ends prematurely if that ally dies.",
      "Agh's Scepter Eclipse can be targeted on any allied unit except ward-type units. You can even target it on couriers.",
      "A ground targeted Agh's Scepter Eclipse only provides a small radius of ground vision, not flying vision, around the center of the AoE. If enemies are hiding behind trees, but inside the AoE, they won't get hit by the Beams.",
      "Eclipse has a fairly long cast time. It's okay to cast it earlier than you need it just so you can get it off before getting perma-stunned.Since the cast time is so long, enemies will often be able to evacuate the area before any Beams even connect. Try to cast the spell in a way where the enemy can't easily leave once they see you like from fog, or behind trees, or after the enemy team is fully committed to a fight.",

      "Eclipse turns the map to night for 10 seconds. If you see a bunch of enemies moments away from ganking you and you really don't want to die, you can use Eclipse's night to potentially hide yourself from enemy vision."

    "counter_tips": [
      "Luna has one of the highest base move speeds in the game, so as tempting as it can be to dive her in the early game, it can be risky without disables.",
      "Luna has bonus night vision thanks to her Lunar Blessing innate, so you need to be sneaky if you're trying to gank her at night.",
      "Once your tier 3 tower goes down, get ready to enter Glaive City. Not only will this damage everything in sight, but there is a high probability that your Blink Dagger is going to get disabled from an errant Glaive. Stand as far as possible from your structures if you're planning on Blink initiating.",
      "Luna's Moon Glaives passive and Lunar Blessing innate can both be disabled by Breaks.Breaks can be provided with items like Silver Edge or Khanda. Spells that Break include Hoodwink's Sharpshooter, Naga Siren's Agh's Scepter Ensnare, Phantom Assassin's Agh's Scepter Fan of Knives, Shadow Demon's Agh's Scepter Demonic Purge, Viper's Viper Strike, anda few others.",

      "Eclipse can be a terrifying spell, but there are ways to deal with it. Summons and illusions are a good way to mitigate the risk of eating Beams. Blade Mail could potentially kill her if you're tanky."
