      "If you ground target Shockwave from fog, you won't reveal yourself to the enemy who gets hit by it. If you directly target them, they'll get vision of you.This is true for any spell that has the option between ground and direct unit targeting. If you ever directly target an enemy unit, the enemy team will briefly get vision of your hero. If you ground target, you won't be revealed through fog.",

      "Shockwave's pull is not a stun and does not cancel channels, it just applies forced movement on enemies.However, the forced movement mechanic doesmoveenemies. This allows it to interrupt spells that apply forced movement on casters like Pangolier's Shield Crash, Phoenix's Icarus Dive, Primal Beast's Onslaught, Spirit Breaker's Charge, Tiny's Toss, Techies' Blast Off, and Templar Assassin's Meld to name a few.",

      "Ranged allies still benefit from Empower bonus damage. You can't give Windranger cleavage, but I'm sure she wouldn't mind the extra damage.",
      "Empower only amplifies base damage and damage from attribute items, not raw damage (green damage) items.",
      "Cleave range benefits from AoE bonuses, like from Gleipnir. For Empower, the AoE bonus is tied to Magnus, not the hero receiving the Empower buff. So it doesn't matter if your target has a Gleipnir, Magnus would need the Gleipnir to increase Empower's cleave range.",
      "Skewer only goes as far as you click if you're not maxing out the range. I know you're really excited that you actually landed a 3-man Reverse Polarity, now just pan the camera over a bit before casting Skewer so you can bring the enemies to your team.That being said, no one is forcing you to always Skewer the max distance. You can also use it at close range mid-gank to inject enemies with the move speed slow or use it to destroy a treeline to help your team close a gap.",

      "When Skewering to escape, don't freaking carpool with the people who are ganking you. It's smart to go past cliffs with Skewer, but it's dumb if you're bringing the enemy with you. Choose a Skewer destination that is not only far, but also at an angle that won't drag undesirables along for the ride.",
      "You can use a close range Shockwave to set up for a Skewer since the enemy may get pulled behind your hero.Skewer's grab AoE is a circle around Magnus, not just the front of his horn. Enemies can be behind Magnus and you'll still pull them if they're close enough to your hero. Therefore, your full combo should be Reverse Polarity \u2192 Shockwave to bring them closer \u2192 Skewer backwards now that they're touching your hero.If Shockwave is on cooldown, you can also line enemies up for a convenient backwards Skewer by turning during your RP cast animation. Blink in, quickly right click move command behind your hero towards the angle you want to Skewer, then immediately cast RP. The move command will be canceled by casting RP, but turn animations arenotcanceled by casting spells. If done correctly, your hero will be turned around when RP ends and all the enemies will be stunned in front of you, primed for Skewering.",

      "Using Harpoon on an enemy will always bring the target into Skewer's pull AoE if you're fast.",
      "By default, your team of random pubs will generally assume that you're not going to Skewer after a good Reverse Polarity if they're close by. It's worth sacrificing the positional benefit from Skewer just to make sure you're not causing your teammates to whiff their spells on where they thought the enemies would be.",
      "Keep your finger primed on your 'stop' hotkey when you're initiating or ganking. It's pretty easy to tell when you're about to whiff your Reverse Polarity, so be prepared to cancel your cast.Faking Reverse Polarity can also be useful to bait certain spells that could evade your stun on reaction, like Puck Phase Shift or Phantom Lancer Doppelganger.",
      "Faking Reverse Polarity can also be useful to bait certain spells that could evade your stun on reaction, like Puck Phase Shift or Phantom Lancer Doppelganger.",
      "After you Blink into the enemy team, right click behind you as you cast Reverse Polarity. This'll get Magnus to rotate as you're casting RP and all the enemies get stunned at the desired Skewer angle without you having to cast Shockwave to pull them behind you."

      "Magnus cannot cast Skewer while rooted/leashed.",
      "When you're mid against Mag, it's obvious when he's trying to push the lane and quickly kill the full wave. He's going to auto attack all the creeps a bit and then he's going to Shockwave at whatever angle will finish the most creeps. There isn't much you can do to stop this, but at least don't get hit by the Shockwave that isn't even meant for you.",
      "If you're worried about Magnus blinking in on your team and starting a team fight, you can try spam casting a disable on the ground near your team. You may end up clicking on him the moment he blinks in.If you have vision of Magnus, you can keep casting and canceling your disable so that the moment he blinks it, your hero will immediately target him with the spell. This is especially useful with instant disables like the cyclone from Eul's.",
