      "You can Grave Chill any enemy or neutral unit. If you see the enemy coming to gank you, just Chill the nearest creep and make a break for it. If you and your Familiars are trying to catch up to an enemy, Chill a neutral in the jungle to get in range quicker.",
      "Familiars need to be within 900 range of your hero to benefit from the Grave Chill cast and Gravekeeper's Cloak bonuses.",
      "Resummoning Familiars automatically refreshes their Stone Form cooldowns.",
      "Casting Stone Form from your hero won't give Magic Stick charges to enemies, but casting it from a Familiar does.",
      "You can put Stone Form on alt-cast to turn it into a targeted spell.",
      "There are many other ways to use Familiars other than just for keeping you company. Use Brooklyn and Lexington to stack ancients, send them to gank a different lane, snipe some quick tower damage if your lane creeps have disabled backdoor protection, or put them behind a lane and use them to distract the next creep wave before a dive.With clever positioning,you can just straight up cut creep waveswithout creeps being able to fight back.",
      "With clever positioning,you can just straight up cut creep waveswithout creeps being able to fight back.",
      "Most supports have a tough time dealing with your Familiars, so in team fights you can try sending them straight on the squishiest enemy to quickly force them out of a fight rather than immediately converging on the enemy carry.",
      "Familiars deal physical damage which make them pair well with minus armor.",
      "It's often worthwhile to keep a ward on the cliff between the enemy's secret shop and fountain. If you spot an enemy courier making its way over, you can try sending your Familiars to snipe it while it's shopping.",
      "You can try hiding your Familiars near the back of the Rosh pit to get vision whenever Rosh respawns or to keep track of how quickly an enemy is killing Rosh.",
      "Like all invis spells, you can cast Agh's Scepter Silent as the Grave while you're channeling a TP."

    "counter_tips": [
      "You can't see the countdown, but you can select a Familiar and see how much time is left on the Stone Form buff timer so you can prepare to kill it.",
      "Familiars have terrible vision. Don't immediately get scared if you see them floating around. It's possible they have no idea where you are when there aren't any enemy heroes or wards nearby to be their eyes.",
      "Be aware that Scan will turn red on Familiars (and all other creep-heroes).",
      "Crimson Guard is an all-purpose-stop-touching-me-Visage item since damage block works on Familiars.",
      "Brewmaster's Storm Brewling can deal significant damage to Familiars with Dispel Magic dealing damage to summons. Try to burn off Visage's Gravekeeper's Cloak damage resistance stacks first.",
      "Winter Wyvern can be irritating for Visage to deal with. Cold Embrace nullifies all damage from his Familiars and Winter's Cursing Visage next to his Familiars could be fatal.",
      "The damage reduction provided by Visage's Gravekeeper's Cloak passive can be disabled by Breaks.Breaks can be provided with items like Silver Edge or Khanda. Spells that Break include Hoodwink's Sharpshooter, Naga Siren's Agh's Scepter Ensnare, Phantom Assassin's Agh's Scepter Fan of Knives, Shadow Demon's Agh's Scepter Demonic Purge, Viper's Viper Strike, anda few others.",
