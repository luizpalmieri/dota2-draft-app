      "Sven's Vanquisher innate makes you deal bonus damage to stunned enemies.",
      "Storm Hammer stuns and damages everything in its AoE. If an enemy has Linken's Sphere, but is sitting inside their creep wave, just target the Hammer on a creep.",
      "Warcry works fully on illusions and creep-heroes (Visage Familiars, Lone Druid's Spirit Bear, or Warlock's Golem).",
      "God's Strength multiplies Sven's primary attribute/base damage. Meaning, when you go full WOLOLO, only damage from STR is getting multiplied, but items that are adding green + damage (raw damage items) aren't get multiplied.",
      "Agh's Scepter Storm Hammer can dispel things like Ghost Scepter or spells like Omniknight's Guardian Angel. You can also use it to target and dispel heroes that are cycloned.",
      "Unlike most mobility spells, Agh's Scepter Storm Hammer isnotdisabled by roots/leashes. You can even travel in and out of Mars's Arena thanks to the invulnerability as well."
