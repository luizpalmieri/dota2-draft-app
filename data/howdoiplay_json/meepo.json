    "general_tips": [
      "Earthbind can root and reveal invisible targets.",
      "The Earthbind projectile provides flying vision in a small radius as it travels.",
      "Earthbinding an enemy unit provides shared vision over that target (you see what the rooted unit can see). This works on enemy heroes and creeps, but shared vision is not provided when rooting neutrals.",
      "The \"Earthbind Grants True Strike on Targets\" talent isn't just for Meepo, it also gives teammates true strike on targets affected by Earthbind.",
      "The \"Earthbind Grants True Strike on Targets\" talent works against debuff immune/BKB'd enemies. They won't be rooted, but you'll still get true strike for as long as the debuff is on them.",
      "The only reason your whole entourage should be in the fountain is if you just respawned, otherwise there should always be at least one Meepo out on the map. If they all need heals, just rotate them in and keep one somewhere safe in the jungle.",
      "You can Poof to illusions of your hero that are owned by you or your team.",
      "Poof deals damage at the starting and ending locations of a Meepo. If they Poof onto themselves, both damage instances happen around the unit.",
      "You can cast Eul's Scepter (don't need Wind Waker) on any of your Meepos.",
      "Every Meepo can pick up and use runes.",
      "Only the primary Meepo benefits from Moon Shard attack speed.",
      "If the primary Meepo dies to a neutral, you have to wait the full neutral death penalty time. If a clone dies to a neutral or Rosh, there is no added penalty and your death time is calculated off your level.",
      "Consider enabling the console commanddota_player_smart_multiunit_cast trueif you're playing Meepo or Arc Warden. This command makes the game attempt to cast a targeted spell on the first unit that doesn't have the spell on cooldownwithoutyou tabbing through control groups.Here's an example: You have your hero and your other Meeposallselected. You cast Earthbind from your hero and put the spell on cooldown. You can press the spell hotkey again and the game will attempt to cast the spell, skip your hero because it's on cooldown, and then make the next Meepo cast Earthbind. It'll continue skipping any Meepos who have the spell on cooldown until it finds a valid one.",

      "If you need to get to a place quickly on the map from the fountain, you can theoretically buy Boots of Travel, use them from a clone, and then sell them from your hero for the full price. It turns the gold unreliable, but could be handy in certain situations.",
      "While secondary Meepos are capable of gaining experience, they gain a reduced percentage. If you can keep your main hero around when units die, you'll level up faster.",
      "Any buffs/debuffs that were on secondary Meepos before you MegaMeepo'd will continue, but they'll be invulnerable and untargetable as long as they're standing on your head.",
      "Any buffs/debuffs applied to your Agh's Scepter MegaMeepo will continue on to your primary Meepo once the spell times out.If you pick up a shield rune while in MegaMeepo, you get to keep the gigantic barrier on your primary Meepo.",
      "If you pick up a shield rune while in MegaMeepo, you get to keep the gigantic barrier on your primary Meepo.",
      "Dropping/backpacking Agh's Scepter will immediately end MegaMeepo. You can use this as an eject button if you don't want to wait for the spell to time out.You can even backpack Agh's Scepter while MegaMeepo is stunned or banished or under some other debuff and your secondary Meepos will immediately be free to act while your primary Meepo continues the debuff.",
      "You can even backpack Agh's Scepter while MegaMeepo is stunned or banished or under some other debuff and your secondary Meepos will immediately be free to act while your primary Meepo continues the debuff.",
      "Agh's Scepter MegaMeepo can't save Meepos that are in Enigma's Black Hole, Faceless Void's Chronosphere, or Legion Commander's Duel. Youcansave them from spells like Batrider's Lasso, Doom's Doom, Necrophos's Reaper's Scythe, and Primal Beast's Pulverize.You can also save Meepos from Winter Wyvern's Winter's Curse, but I'm pretty sure it's unintended. If you Poof into your Cursed crew and shift+queue MegaMeepo, you'll make a frozen tower of Meepos and walk away from the Curse.This also works against Disruptor's Static Field.",

      "This also works against Disruptor's Static Field.",
      "Upon ending Agh's Scepter MegaMeepo, your secondary Meepos will continue performing the last action you gave them before you went MegaMeepoMode. So be prepared for them to run in some dumb directions once the MegaMeepo falls apart."

    "counter_tips": [
      "Earthbind has a massive cast animation and travel time, so it's fairly easy to juke. Meepos have to predict your path almost a whole second in advance, so just change your trajectory to avoid the net.",
      "Meepos find success when they can isolate a dying Meepo and free them from the fight. A way to counter that is with heavy lock down for a single Meepo so it can't Poof out or by using silences, roots/leashes, or multi-instance stuns (like Clockwerk's Battery Assault, Enigma's Malefice, Invoker's Cold Snap, or Witch Doctor's Paralyzing Cask).",
      "All you really need against Meepo is to have a ton of single target damage to kill one Meepo. You don't get extra credit for dealing damage to his every Meepo. You only need to kill one.",
      "Meepo struggles to deal with Winter Wyvern's Winter's Curse.Technically,if you don't catch the primary Meepo he can pull some Agh's Scepter MegaMeepo shenanigans to get out, but only the godliest Meepos know about that tech that is literally one scroll up on this screen.",
      "Each Meepo counts as an individual hero when calculating Pangolier's Shield Crash buff.",
      "Pretty much all of Grimstroke's spells aside from Phantom's Embrace are amazing against Meepo.",
      "Elder Titan gets a ton of buffs for running over a bunch of Meepos with his Spirit.",
      "Meepo can't cast Agh's Shard Dig while rooted/leashed.",
      "Individual Meepos can be Tracked by Bounty Hunter and when one dies you get gold for each one Tracked.",
      "Shiva's Guard can be pretty value versus a Meepo with the attack/move speed slow, AoE damage, and HP regen reduction."
