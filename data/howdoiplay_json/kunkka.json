      "Abuse Torrent's huge cast range. The spell has a very obvious cast animation and will likely get juked if the enemy sees you Bellamy salute. Cast it from the fog or high ground.",
      "Your hero can be facing in any direction when casting Torrent.",
      "Torrent provides a small radius of vision around its cast location.",
      "If you get body blocked by enemies in trees, you can Torrent the enemy and walk underneath them.",
      "Torrent deals multiple ticks of damage over the course of the spell.",
      "Torrent deals damage and slow to all enemies in the AoE even if they didn't get hit by the stun.The constant Torrent damage in the AoE can be useful at canceling Blink Daggers on enemies that aren't targetable yet. Like someone TP'ing into a fight or respawning from an Aegis.",
      "The constant Torrent damage in the AoE can be useful at canceling Blink Daggers on enemies that aren't targetable yet. Like someone TP'ing into a fight or respawning from an Aegis.",
      "If you cast Torrent at around 57.5 seconds of any minute, you can use it to stack a jungle camp. This only works oncertaincamps, however. The reason is because Torrent raises the creeps above the spawn box check height,but different camps have different heights.You'll have to test it in a lobby yourself (use the-spawnneutralscommand with cheats enabled) to see which camps work and which ones don't.",
      "The only aspect of Tidebringer that the primary target gets hit by is the bonus right click damage. The cleave damagedoes not affect the primary target.Since the cleave damage from Tidebringer is an amplified amount of your base attack damage, obviously you'd rather waste your 100% damage right click on an unimportant target so that your multiplied damage can cleave onto a more important target.",
      "You can Tidebringer splash a Bane Nightmared unit and they won't wake up.",
      "The splash particle effect from Tidebringer can indirectly show where an invisible unit is.",
      "You can cast X Marks on yourself or an ally before getting teleported somewhere. Use this to quickly go back home, chug a few Bottle charges or pick up something from the shop, and then quickly come back on the lane.",
      "If you cast X Marks Return on a hero who's getting Lassoed by Batrider, it'll instantly cancel the Lasso.",
      "You can cast X Marks on debuff immune/BKB'd enemies and wait for their immunity to time out before Returning them.",
      "If you're playing against enemies with short banishes (like Shadow Demon's Disruption, Puck's Phase Shift, Phantom Lancer's Doppelganger, anyone with Eul's, etc) stop-cancel your Torrent animation after X-ing to bait out usage of these banishes. Then just wait for the banish to end and continue the combo.",
      "The stun from the Ghostship is nice, but defensively casting the boat to receive the Rum for the move speed and delayed damage buffs can be invaluable. There's no such thing as a fail boat.",
      "Multiple Rum sources, such as from your Admiral's Rum innate, the \"Grog Blossom\" facet, or the Ghostship Rum buff, don't stack their damage reduction. If one Rum buff is active, there's no advantage to receiving another source."

    "counter_tips": [
      "If Kunkka's sword is glowing that means Tidebringer is off cooldown.",
      "Cleave damage, such as from Tidebringer, is reduced by damage block and armor.",
      "Kunkka can't use Tidebringer if he's affected by Breaks.Breaks can be provided with items like Silver Edge or Khanda. Spells that Break include Hoodwink's Sharpshooter, Naga Siren's Agh's Scepter Ensnare, Phantom Assassin's Agh's Scepter Fan of Knives, Shadow Demon's Agh's Scepter Demonic Purge, Viper's Viper Strike, anda few others.",

      "Kunkka's Admiral's Rum innate that provides him with extra survivability can be disabled by Breaks.",
      "Activating debuff immunity/BKB will prevent you from getting Returned from an X. Invulnerability, like from Cycloning yourself with Eul's or getting banished, can also dodge the Return, but you need to time it.If you're playing against an extremely good Kunkka, they may fake the Torrent animation to bait you into Cycloning yourself preemptively. The best way to counter-counterplay this is to keep an eye on his mana bar. If it goes down, he committed to the Torrent cast.You can also use the Eul's cyclone tactic on enemy X's. If Kunkka's being coy by X'ing himself or an ally and then going massively out of position before getting auto-Returned, try timing a Eul's so that they'll be mid-cyclone when the X buff times out.",

      "There is a sweaty,but somewhat reliable method, to instantly Blink out of an X Return. X cancels any cast animations your hero is in the middle of upon Returning. You can take advantage of this by starting a cast animation before the Return happens and then begin spamming your Blink Dagger during this cast animation. As soon as you get Returned, your spell's cast will be canceled and your Blink Dagger targeting spam will be the next command your hero takes.For example, say you're Shadow Fiend against Kunkka. Begin casting Requiem while you're X'd and start spamming your Blink Dagger. As soon as the X Return triggers, Requiem's cast animation will be canceled and your Blink spam will start going through. Requiem is obviously a very easy example since it has a long cast animation.You can't shift+queue this strategy because Return cancels your shift+queue order.",

      "You can't shift+queue this strategy because Return cancels your shift+queue order.",
      "Rubick has an interesting Spell Steal interaction with X Marks. If Rubick X Marks the same target as Kunkka, the first one to cast Return will prevent the other's Return from going off.For example, Rubick could X an ally who's already been X'd by Kunkka, very quickly Return them to override Kunkka's X, and now Kunkka's Return won't work.",
      "For example, Rubick could X an ally who's already been X'd by Kunkka, very quickly Return them to override Kunkka's X, and now Kunkka's Return won't work.",
      "Torrent doesn't deal enough damage to proc a Raindrop, so keeping one handy could save you from a lot of Ghostship damage.",
      "Agh's Shard Tidal Wave only disarms you. You can still cast spells and items while you're surfing."
