      "The bonus damage charges you get on Refraction don't get consumed on denial attacks, but you also don't get the bonus damage when issuing deny attacks.",
      "Learn how to maintain aggro in lane to ensure that creeps won't burn off Refraction barrier charges.",
      "Since the entire damage instance is blocked, Refraction prevents Blink Dagger or consumable regen from breaking if you get hit.",
      "The cooldown on Refraction is the same as its duration. Before going in for a gank or joining a team fight, you want a fully charged Refraction to be on the tail end of its timer so you can put a fresh one up when everything inevitably starts going wrong.",
      "Meld has no cast time and no fade time. This is useful for disjointing spells, tower shots, and right clicks, but it's also huge for juking. When you're getting chased, Meld as soon as you get a moment of high ground above the enemies. If you're juking in the jungle, Meld as soon as you think you're in a split-second of fog. Chances are the enemy will assume you kept running and continue chasing the same direction.",
      "You have no collision when you're Melded, so you won't block pathways.",
      "If you have trouble landing Meld strikes in the heat of the moment, try using attack+move commands instead of right clicking on the enemy.",
      "The armor reduction debuff from Meld works on Rosh. The debuff stacks as well, so you should try to double-Meld Rosh when you first start taking it.",
      "Melding a unit makes your Psi Blades deal more damage on spill targets since the primary unit will have reduced armor.",
      "To be an effective Lanaya, you've got to learn how to play Psi Blades like a concert pianist. A deny could be used to pick up a last hit in the same stroke. A full creep wave should be wiped in two spills after you pick up a Desolator. Move creeps and neutrals in the jungle around to get the perfect spills.",
      "Psi Blade's spill angle is calculated from TA's position once the attack connects, not from where TA was when the attack was started. It's not much, but you can ever so slightly move yourself around after you attack to change spill angles onto the enemy.",
      "You can target your Traps with deny attacks to give a target to Psi Blade spill off of. If an enemy is escaping out of your attack range or vision, try planting a Trap in a line behind them and immediately deny it to potentially spill onto the enemy.With the \"Voidblades\" facet, you can even spill Meld damage off of denying attacks.",
      "With the \"Voidblades\" facet, you can even spill Meld damage off of denying attacks.",
      "Psi Blade spill damage can hit ethereal units.",
      "Psi Blade spill damage can hit invisible units.",
      "Psi Blade damage can spill through Venomancer's Plague Wards and Techies' Proximity Mines, but not any other types of ward units (other than your Traps). Probably because other ward units require a number of attacks to kill, but these have actual HP.However, with the \"Voidblades\" facet, Meld damagecanspill through all ward units.",
      "However, with the \"Voidblades\" facet, Meld damagecanspill through all ward units.",
      "You can give shared control of your Traps to all of your teammates so they can detonate your Traps themselves by opening the scoreboard and clicking the \"Show Shared Unit Control Options\" icon in the bottom corner. Please notify your teammates that you're doing this otherwise you're going to sabotage their micro.",
      "The core early game Trap locations for vision are the runes (or at least one rune), their side of the mid hill, your side of the mid hill, and choke points on stairs. Mid/late game should include Traps on the Twin Gates and jungle camps the enemy may like to farm.Traps don't give vision when placedinsidethe Rosh pit, but it's still worth putting a Trap in front of the pit entrance so you can catch when the enemy may be walking in to Rosh.",
      "Traps don't give vision when placedinsidethe Rosh pit, but it's still worth putting a Trap in front of the pit entrance so you can catch when the enemy may be walking in to Rosh.",
      "Towers are extremely slow at killing Traps. If you're diving, you can plant a Trap in tower aggro range without fear of it immediately dying to tower shots.",
      "Damage from multiple Traps won't stack.",
      "The last Trap debuff an enemy is hit by will immediately overwrite the previous Trap debuff (for both the slow and damage).",
      "If you are within ~1800 range of a neutral camp, you can draw aggro and stack it with Psionic Trap damage. Be sure to account for the Trap slow affecting the neutrals with your stack timings.",
      "If you're close to messing up a stack, try using a Trap to slow down the neutrals before they make it back inside their spawn box.",
      "You can use Trap damage on lane creeps to split push lanes.",
      "The \"Meld Hit Bash\" talent can stun enemies through debuff immunity/BKB.",
      "The \"Meld Hit Bash\" talent works with her \"Voidblades\" facet and will stun everyone who gets hit by the Meld spill.",
      "TA is an excellent hero to learn Tread switching on since she can make use of all three attributes and frequently gets a Bottle."

      "If you apply \"overkill\" damage onto a layer of TA's Refraction barrier, it won't start cutting into the next layer. Any single damage instance beyond removing a layer to 0 will be ignored.Damage over time spells are a convenient way to add damage instances that can help tick a Refraction barrier past 0 to start using the next layer. Batrider, Jakiro, Phoenix, Venomancer, and Viper are examples of heroes with spells that are handy at clearing off Refraction.Items that apply DoTs like Blood Grenade, Urn of Shadows/Spirit Vessel, and Radiance can also slowly help tick Refraction barriers past 0.Illusion heroes (like Naga Siren, Phantom Lancer, and Terrorblade) are good at dealing with Refraction since each illusion's attack could remove a Refraction layer.",

      "Illusion heroes (like Naga Siren, Phantom Lancer, and Terrorblade) are good at dealing with Refraction since each illusion's attack could remove a Refraction layer.",
      "You can't break TA's Meld with any stun or silence since Meld invisibility is an infinite duration undispellable buff, not a channeled spell. Your team really needs to have ground targeted spells or detection (Dust or sentry wards), otherwise she'll just sit there until her Blink comes off cooldown.However, spells that change her horizontal position withforced movement or knockbacklike Batrider's Flamebreak, Clockwerk's Power Cogs, Dark Seer's Vacuum, Drow Ranger's Gust, Invoker's Deafening Blast, Keeper of the Light's Blinding Light, Magnus's Skewer, Mars's Spear, Primal Beast's Onslaught, Queen of Pain's Sonic Wave, Spirit Breaker's Charge, or Void Spirit's Aether Remnant can break Meld by moving her.",

      "Know what you're getting yourself into if you dive a TA. Can you handle her having Refraction? Do you have detection if she Melds? Will you be able to kill her if she has five Traps lying around?",
      "Always be moving around when you're against her mid. Make her miss last hits because she's too busy trying to spill on you.",
      "If you activate Glyph, Psi Blades can't Spill any damage off of your creeps. Could be handy to know in a low HP mid lane skirmish situation.",
      "If you're mid against Lanaya, get some sentry wards at around 5 minutes. Not only will this allow you to actually finish a gank on her if you get the upper hand and she tries to hide with Meld, but you can also clear the Trap(s) that you know she has on your side of the hill.If you have a spell that she can disjoint in the laning phase with Meld invisibility, it can be worth getting a sentry ward even earlier.",
      "If you have a spell that she can disjoint in the laning phase with Meld invisibility, it can be worth getting a sentry ward even earlier.",
      "Smokes are great against teams with a TA since they will often be lazy when spamming observer wards if they can rely on Trap vision. On the other hand, you need to be careful that you're not Smoking on top of a Trap.",
      "Traps don't give vision if placedinsidethe Rosh pit, but she may have seen your team walking into the pit with a Trap in front of the pit entrance. All the more reason to Smoke into the pit when against a TA.Runes are also very commonly Trapped by TA, so she may see you if you're camping the rune before it spawns.",
