      "Terrorblade's Dark Unity innate changes how much damage your illusions do depending on how far they are from your hero.",
      "Reflection works on heroes that are in fog, but not invisible heroes.",
      "Reflection illusions carry all the auras that normal illusions carry.",
      "Reflection illusions don't consider Terrorblade to be the damage source, so you don't need to worry about Reflection illusions damaging an enemy Blade Mail or Nyx Assassin's Spiked Carapace and reflecting onto your main hero.",
      "Reflection illusions benefit from an active Agh's Shard Demon Zeal buffs.",
      "Use Conjure Image illusions to stack the jungle, serve as wards, intercept an incoming creep wave, or deny runes in the early game.",
      "Terrorblade illusions can only be in Metamorphosis form if the real hero is within 1200 range of them.",
      "If you create an illusion on theexact same tickthat Metamorphosis times out on your hero, the illusion will spawn in Metamorphosis form for its entire duration. This works with Conjure Image and Manta Style illusions.",
      "Each Conjure Image cast spawns the illusion in a counterclockwise fashion around your hero. The first cast is north of your hero, the next cast will spawn west of your hero, then south, then east, and repeat. Not particularly useful, but it is cool trivia.",
      "Sunder can be cast on allies and illusions (like Conjure Image or Manta Style illusions).",
      "Sunder has a minimum HP transfer percentage. If you and a target are both under the percentage, Sunder will heal you both to the minimum.If you take the \"Condemned\" facet, there is no minimum limit on Sunder when cast on enemies.",
      "If you take the \"Condemned\" facet, there is no minimum limit on Sunder when cast on enemies.",
      "If you use Sunder while in a \"wraith\" form, like from Wraith King's Agh's Scepter or the \"Helm of the Undying\" neutral item artifact, you will Sunder the target as if you have 1 HP.",
      "You can Sunder through Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast to gain HP. You can Sunder a Borrowed Time Abaddon to make him lose HP. Sunder is considered an HP \"swap,\" it doesn't behave as a heal.",
      "You can't Sunder debuff immune/BKB'd enemies or allies.",
      "Infused Raindrops are amazing on TB. He has tons of armor, but is very susceptible to magic damage nukes. The mana regen from the item is just gravy.",
      "There is a brief delay when activating Agh's Scepter Terror Wave before the fear actually goes out.",
      "Agh's Scepter Terror Wave will follow your hero as you move similar to a Shiva's Guard active."
    ],
    "counter_tips": [
      "The Reflection slow and illusion can be removed with basic dispels.",
      "Reflection illusions carry all things that normal illusions carry. This includes item auras, so be wary about building things like Radiance or Assault Cuirass against a TB.",
      "TB has armor for days, but very little HP to back it up. Magic damage makes life for TB and his illusions hell. If your team is mostly physical damage, consider building Maelstrom or Shiva's (yeah I know I just told you not to build auras, but Shiva's is usually worth it) to clear his illusions.",
      "Sunder. It's a spell. One that you should be acutely aware of when trying to kill him.",
      "Any level of Dagon can instakill illusions. As do spells like Disruptor's Glimpse, Pudge's Meat Hook, Skywrath Mage's Mystic Flare, and any Hex.Brewmaster's Storm Brewling with Dispel Magic deals full damage to all types of illusions.",
      "Brewmaster's Storm Brewling with Dispel Magic deals full damage to all types of illusions.",
      "Enchantress can take control of enemy illusions with Enchant.",
      "Illusions your team creates of an enemy Terrorblade will spawn in Metamorphosis form if the hero himself has it activated, but they won't transform if TB activates Meta afterwards. The transformation only works on illusions Terrorblade owns.",
      "If you're a carry, consider buying a Revenant's Brooch to bypass Terrorblade's extremely high armor in the late game.",
      "The Agh's Scepter Terror Wave fear can be dispelled by basic dispels."
