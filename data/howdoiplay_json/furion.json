      "Try hugging trees whenever it's convenient to take advantage of the damage given from your Spirit of the Forest innate.",
      "Sprout gives a small radius of flying vision around the trees when cast. Use Sprout to scout enemies who are juking in fog, counter ward cliffs, or to get that last hit on the flying courier who just flew out of vision.",
      "Target your Sprout during the Teleport animation when you're going in for a gank. You'll cast it as soon as you're in range and have vision of the target rather than fumbling around the moment you get there.",
      "Sprout can be hero targeted. However, you can utilize ground targeting if the enemy has a Linken's Sphere or if you're trying to guess where an invis hero went.It can also be worthwhile to ground target the entire Sproutaheadof the enemy in a chokepoint. Most enemies will have ways to cut through a single tree, but not many can quickly cut their way through multiple trees.",
      "It can also be worthwhile to ground target the entire Sproutaheadof the enemy in a chokepoint. Most enemies will have ways to cut through a single tree, but not many can quickly cut their way through multiple trees.",
      "If you ground target Sprout from fog, you won't reveal yourself to the enemy who gets hit by it. If you directly target them, they'll get vision of you.This is true for any spell that has the option between ground and direct unit targeting. If you ever directly target an enemy unit, the enemy team will briefly get vision of your hero. If you ground target, you won't be revealed through fog.",

      "You can Sprout enemy towers to block their vision. This is really only useful if you need to briefly reduce enemy vision around a tower for some reason, like during a dive. Remember that attacking any unit gives that team vision of the attacking unit, so you can't attack a tower without it seeing you.You can also Sprout your team's buildings defensively. However, your towers will still shoot at enemies if you have vision of them, which in turn gives enemies vision of your attacking tower. Defensive Sprouting is mainly useful on buildings that don't attack, like your barracks or your Ancient.That's right, your Ancient. The big ass building you're trying to protect apparently cannot be seen by enemies if you Sprout the middle of it. This interaction could buy you some valuable seconds in a final defense. Defense of the Ancient.",

      "Tangoes used on Sprout trees created by the \"Soothing Saplings\" facet heal extra like Iron Branch trees.",
      "Casting Sprout on a target in Clockwerk's Power Cogs will always shove everyoneexceptthe main target out of the Cogs.",
      "Always carry a TP scroll. A scroll gives you an immediate escape after you finish Teleporting in to snipe a courier, kill a fleeing hero, or cut the creep wave.",
      "Courier sniping is relevant all game long. Consider buying your own observer wards and planting them in areas that can spot couriers traveling to and from the fountain or secret shop.",
      "95% of the raising the roof animation for Teleport will stay under the invis granted by Shadow Blade or an invis rune.",
      "You can use press the 'stop' hotkey at any point of the Teleportation cast animation to cancel it without putting it on cooldown.You can use Teleportation to mindgame enemies. If you see your teammate is getting ganked, start casting a Teleport right on top of the enemies, even if you only have 10 HP, just to freak them out. The animation is pretty obvious and is long enough that you can easily cancel it.",

      "When ganking in the early game, Teleport into places out of vision like inside trees or behind the lane.",
      "Memorize the timings of important objectives around the map, like runes, so you can Teleport and steal them from the enemy.",
      "You can teleport into the treelines around the enemy base to safely/sneakilyplant high ground wards before a siege.",
      "How to avoid dying as Prophet:Step 1: Run away a little bit.Step 2: Cast Sprout on yourself (if you have the \"Double Tap Ability to Self Cast\" setting enabled, just double tap the hotkey) so no one can see you during your private time.Step 3: Double tap the Teleport hotkey to automatically target the fountain.Step 4: Do it all over again in a minute because the enemy never learns.",

      "Step 4: Do it all over again in a minute because the enemy never learns.",
      "Treants are great units for distracting a creep wave. Just send one up ahead to lead the enemy creeps on a wild goose chase while you continue beating on the tower.",
      "Treants are great units for scouting. Send them on choke points where you don't have vision to keep track of enemy whereabouts.",
      "Treants are great units for blocking camps. They move fast and are usually too tanky for enemies to kill if you plop them down right before a camp is about to spawn.",
      "Learn how Wrath of Nature works and how to maximize the damage on high priority targets. It has the same number of bounces at all levels, so you typically want to cast it if you can see heroes on the minimap and at least 2 lanes have creeps fighting at the moment.",
      "Linken's Sphere will pop if you directly target Wrath of Nature onto an enemy hero, but the spell will continue bouncing.",
      "Agh's Scepter Wrath of Nature disarms targets for the root duration."

    "counter_tips": [
      "QUELLING BLAAAAADE. Also Tangoes or Battle Fury. Few spells can lose effectiveness so dramatically as Sprout does from such cheap items. If your ally is Sprouted, be a pal and use one of these to get them out.Learn which spells can break trees as well (especially the not so obvious ones like Io's Tether, Leshrac's Split Earth, Lina's Light Strike Array, Undying's Tombstone, etc). These can also come in handy to invade NP's little home when he Sprouts himself to Teleport out. Keep at least 1 Tango or QB item on hand in the mid game if you don't have any of these spells and late game use Force Staff.",

      "The barrier NP gets after Teleportation can be removed with dispels.",
      "Keep a close eye on your courier. You can protect it with the Shield or Speed Burst if Prophet is trying to make a move on it.",
      "If you see Wrath of Nature bouncing around, back out of the lane to get out of vision and stay there for a few seconds. If you're wondering how his ult just hit you in the middle of your jungle, either Riki is stalking you or they have a ward.",
      "Save your stun/silence for the end of his Teleport animation. He's effectively disabling himself for free while he's standing still mid-animation. Let him think that he's going to get out while you're whittling him down with auto attacks, then disable his cast at the last moment.",
      "Prophet faces in the direction that he's Teleporting. While not always useful, if you see him Teleporting you can warn your teammates where he's probably traveling to.",
      "Nature's Prophet can't cast Teleportation while rooted/leashed.",
      "Dagon instakills non-ancient creeps. If NP is being a menace with his \"Ironwood Treant\" facet, Dagon could be a solution to deal with it. As a bonus, Dagon heals you for a percentage of the damage dealt. Which, for an instakill, is equal to the current HP of the creep when you zap it."
