      "Manually casting Frost Arrows on enemy heroes won't draw creep aggro.",
      "The knockback on Gust doesn't break item channels, so don't bother using it to cancel a TP.However, the knockback mechanic doesmoveenemies, making it cancel things like Magnus's Skewer, Phoenix's Icarus Dive, Primal Beast's Onslaught, Spirit Breaker's Charge, Techies' Blast Off, and Templar Assassin's Meld.",

      "Gust reveals invisible units for the duration of the silence.",
      "The \"Gust Self Movement Speed\" talent works even if you don't hit any enemies with the spell. If you need to make a quick escape, just use it on nothing and start running.",
      "Beware that Gust knockback can potentially push enemies out of a teammate Disruptor's Kinetic Field or Slark's Pounce leash.",
      "Multishot gives a small amount of flying vision over the projectiles.",
      "Multishot scales off your base damage. It does not multiply 'green' +dmg.",
      "Despite its appearance, Multishot isnotaninstant attack. Therefore, the arrows donotapply attack modifiers (other than Frost Arrows), the spell won't break enemy Tranquil Boots, and it won't remove a Smoke buff off your hero if an attack lands on a target.",
      "If you take the \"Sidestep\" facet, Drow can even attack during Multishotbut only if you're not moving.Also, you can't right click any target during Multishot otherwise that'll cancel the spell. You basically have to stand still while Multishotting and Drow will begin attacking then nearest available target.",
      "You can use Marksmanship's particle effect disappearing on your hero to detect if invis heroes are hugging you.",
      "Marksmanship procs have true strike. Not only will the Marksmanship damage go through, but so does your right click damage. This provides a built-in counter to evasion heroes.",
      "While Drow's Precision Aura innate does add a buff indicator to creep-heroes (like Visage's Familiars), they can't benefit from the AGI in any way.",
      "While standing on Agh's Shard Glacier, Marksmanship won't be disabled by nearby enemies.",
      "You can activate Agh's Shard Glacier while in the middle of channeling Multishot and it won't cancel it, but you won't get the bonus arrows.",
      "All units benefit from the bonus attack range when standing on Glacier. Creeps, heroes, and even enemies.Even melee heroes can benefit from the bonus attack range when standing on Agh's Shard Glacier.",
      "Even melee heroes can benefit from the bonus attack range when standing on Agh's Shard Glacier.",
      "Agh's Shard Glacier basically gives Drow a really short duration free pathing buff similar to Spectre's Spectral Dagger. The intention is to let you walk off the front of the Glacier, but if you line the Glacier up with a cliff, you can walk over walls too.",
      "Standing on Agh's Shard Glacier is like standing on two 'levels' of high ground in terms of how vision works. To get vision of you, the enemy would need to have a ward or hero that's two ramps/stairs higher than you, similar to seeing a Monkey King that's perched on a tree.Most sources of accuracy won't work when attacking buildings, but Agh's Shard Glacier does. If you're sieging an enemy high ground tower, you won't miss any attacks on it from low ground if you're standing on Glacier. Your attacks will have true strike and can't miss due to blinds or evasion.The \"Vantage Point\" facet benefits from this high ground aspect of Glacier. You can use this to create instant high grounds for bonus damage against all units, including Roshan or towers. It doesn't matter how high up the enemy target actually is, standing on Glacier always counts as higher ground.Be aware attacking any enemies always gives vision of the attacker. So if you're using Glacier to hide/escape, don't attack anything.",

      "Nullifier can dispel the Force Staff buff off heroes. However, it does not dispel the Hurricane Pike pushback buff. If you're trying to escape while Nullified, casting Pike on yourself won't work to create a gap, but Piking an enemy will."

    "counter_tips": [
      "Get in her face. There is nothing Drows hate more than someone in melee range of her. She loses the bonuses from Marksmanship if enemy heroes are close to her, so try closing the distance even if you're a ranged hero.Illusions won't disable Marksmanship, only actual heroes.",
      "Illusions won't disable Marksmanship, only actual heroes.",
      "Gust reveals invisible units for the duration of the silence.",
      "Drow is a ranged hero so Halberd's disarm lasts longer on her.",
      "Marksmanship procs bypass your hero'smainarmor, but not bonus armor. This means that armor gained from agility won't help you very much against her, but raw armor items can be quite useful.",
      "Evasion isn't too useful against Drow Ranger because Marksmanship gives her built-in accuracy.",
      "Agh's Scepter Hypothermia stacks can be dispelled.",
      "It doesn't matter whose team the Agh's Shard Glacier belongs to, any unit standing on it gets bonus attack range."
