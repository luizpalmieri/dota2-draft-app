      "Devour bonus gold is unreliable and granted when the buff expires.",
      "Devour with alt-cast active (which can be toggled by right clicking the spell icon, or pressing alt+hotkey, or by holding ctrl+hotkey) allows you to steal abilities from neutral creeps. Toggle it off when you want to Devour a creep that has some useless spell so you don't replace whatever ability you already have consumed.",
      "Learn the abilities and auras of neutral creeps and figure out which one best matches your playstyle at various points of the game.For a defensive early game, get a hard camp big red Satyr for the HP regen, hard/medium camp blue Satyr for the mana regen, or medium camp blue Ogre for the Ice Armor.For an offensive early game, consider the easy camp darker purple Harpy Stormcrafter for the Chain Lightning.The Vhoul Assassins give your attack a passive which applies a heal reduction debuff on enemies, but it only reduces HP regeneration, not heals or lifesteal. This can be situationally useful against heroes like Huskar, Io, Morphling, Timbersaw, or other heroes that buy HP sustain items early on.Mid game, the blue Centaur or Mud Golems provide useful stuns or the little Troll with its Ensnare. Other options could be thegoblet Koboldfor the move speed aura or the Dark Troll Summoner for its Skeletons' Rally aura for pushing.Late game, the Alpha Wolf can be valuable for the crits and damage aura.Situationally, some other creeps can also be useful. The lance Kobold gives you a passive that disarms, the easy camp shield Troll gives you a passive that breaks, the small Ghost gives you an undisjointable silence, the small white Satyr gives you a dispel that can be cast on enemies and allies, and the small Wolf lets you reduce enemy total attack damage.The Wildwing Ripper Hurricane ability can let you pull allies out of Faceless Void's Chronosphere and Enigma's Black Hole. Doesn't work against Disruptor's Kinetic Field, Mars's Arena, or leashes. It can also be self-cast to move yourself into a better position.If you take the \"Devour Can Target Ancients\" talent, some ancients worth considering are the small Frostbitten Golem for the cooldown reduction aura, big Granite Golem for the max HP aura, the big yellow Thunderhide lizard for the attack speed buff, or the blue Thunderhide lizard for the accuracy aura.If enemies are picking up Linken's, find a neutral spell that is targeted to pop them before casting Doom. The longest range targeted neutral spell is the Harpy's Chain Lightning and the Mud Golem's Hurl Boulder is a close second.",

      "Doom has a pretty long cast animation. It can often times be more reliable to initiate with your Infernal Blade attack+stun as opposed to blinking in and trying to get a raw Doom off first.Against heroes with high evasion, you may want to consider building a Witch Blade. Witch Blade gives true strike on its debuff attack, so you can use it in conjunction with Infernal Blade to give some cheap accuracy.",
