      "You can Boulder Smash allies out of Chronosphere if they're reachable on the edge. You can Boulder Smash allies out of leashes like Slark's Pounce or Grimstroke's Soulbind. You can also Smash people out of Disruptor's Kinetic Field.The following interactions are also true with Agh's Shard Geomagnetic Grip working on allies. Except the Chronosphere one. You can't Grip allies out of Chrono.",
      "The following interactions are also true with Agh's Shard Geomagnetic Grip working on allies. Except the Chronosphere one. You can't Grip allies out of Chrono.",
      "If an enemy is standing on you trying to block your Rolling Boulder escape, use Boulder Smash to boot the enemy away first and then Roll away.",
      "If you have the \"Double Tap Ability to Self Cast\" setting enabled, you can double tap the Remnant hotkey to automatically drop one in front of yourself. If you have Quick Cast, you need to enable the \"Smart Double Tap\" setting.",
      "You can drop a Remnant while you're revving up in Rolling Boulder.",
      "After the initial rev up delay, you're fully invulnerable during Rolling Boulder. This means invulnerable to disables (you can roll through an Enigma Black Hole, Faceless Void Chronosphere, Mars Arena) and invulnerable to damage (you can roll while Bloodseeker Rupture'd and won't take damage).As mentioned earlier, you can Boulder Smash allies out of Chronosphere. So consider Rolling yourself through a Chrono while invulnerable and booting an ally out to save them.",

      "If you Roll over the edges of the map, you briefly get high ground vision over the surrounding treeline. This can be useful to scout out enemies that may be hiding or juking.",
      "If you Roll over the edges of the map at an angle, you'll be placed back onto the map without breaking any trees behind you. If you're trying to escape enemies chasing you in the trees, consider doing this instead of bulldozing every tree in a straight line.",
      "There is an extremely small window of time in which you can Smash a Remnant that you're about to Roll into and you'll get the full Roll distance while also sending an invisible Smash projectile.Mechanically, think of it like you're consuming the Remnant with your Roll while it's being Smashed away. Outside of team fights, this can also be an efficient way to clear creep waves with a single Remnant.A consistent way to pull this trick off: Start Roll, double-tap Remnant, target Smash by clicking ON the unit you're trying to hit with Smash. If you don't click Smash directly on the unit, this tech is less reliable.",

      "You can use/target spells while Rolling in your Boulder. This means that you can Smash an ally while you're rolling into them or do a drive-by Gripping.",
      "You can use/target items while Rolling in your Boulder (except Blink and TP scrolls). This can be useful for Shiva's, Scythe of Vyse/Orchid, Eul's Scepter, and wards.",
      "If you use a Force Staff while Rolling Boulder is revving up, you'll get the Force and continue Rolling starting from your new location. There are multiple applications of this interaction:You can Force Staff yourself to potentially phase through an enemy blocking your Boulder path before you start Rolling.You can immediately turn your hero left or right after starting the Roll and Force Staff yourself to change your starting trajectory.Here's a video by Qwerja demonstrating both interactions.",

      "Here's a video by Qwerja demonstrating both interactions.",
      "You can pick up runes while Rolling.",
      "The \"Ready to Roll\" facet counts illusions and creep-heroes (Brewmaster's Primal Split Brewlings, Lone Druid's Spirit Bear, Visage's Familiars, Warlock's Golem) as valid buff targets.",
      "When you hit an enemy hero with Rolling Boulder you'll always appear behind them and at the same angle from which you approached them. You can target your Smash on them while Rolling and you'll immediately kick them back along the path you came.",
      "Nearly all of your spells destroy trees in some way. Useful against heroes like Nature's Prophet or Monkey King.",
      "Neither Smash nor Grip can interrupt ally or enemy channels when directly targeted on the hero.",
      "Reduce, reuse, recycle. Use the same Remnant you just Gripped to Roll into. Smash a Remnant into an enemy then spam Grip to catch it while it's still moving.The disadvantage of recycling is that you end up stacking your total disables on top of each other. If you have Remnants to burn, stagger your spells.",

      "Remember that you can get the Geomagnetic Grip silence from pulling allied creeps too. You don't have to use Remnants to get the silence.",
      "Consider using Geomagnetic Grip on allied creeps to cliff them.Situationally useful for denying experience to enemies in the early game and useful as cheap wards all game long.",
      "The search trigger radius on a Remnant from a Magnetized unit is smaller than the activation/refresh radius to Magnetize new enemies, so place fresh Remnants closer to Magnetized enemies.",
      "Repeatedly Magnetizing an enemy doesn't increase the duration, it just refreshes the debuff. So when trying to maximize damage, wait for the debuff to time out on an enemy before re-Magnetizing them.",
      "If any one Magnetized target gets silenced from Grip or slowed by Smash, all other Magnetized targets will receive the same debuff.",
      "Rolling into an Agh's Scepter Enchant Remnant will immediately take the hero you Stoned out of Remnant form.",
      "You can cast Agh's Scepter Enchant Remnant on yourself as Earth Spirit and then use Boulder Smash on yourself.",
      "Agh's Scepter Enchant Remnant can also be used on Stone Remnants if you want the damage.",
      "If you cast Agh's Scepter Enchant Remnant on a debuff immune/BKB'd target, they become untargetable and invulnerable. This is consistent with allies or enemies.Debuff immune targets becomesountargetable and invulnerable while Enchant Remanant'd that they can even act inside a Faceless Void Chronosphere or Enigma Black Hole.If you Geomagnetic Grip a debuff immune Enchant Remnant'd enemy, it puts the enemy into a persistent flail animation. Completely useless tip, but it is pretty funny.",

      "If you Geomagnetic Grip a debuff immune Enchant Remnant'd enemy, it puts the enemy into a persistent flail animation. Completely useless tip, but it is pretty funny.",
      "You can cast Enchant Remnant on allied ward units. This is mostly useless because the ward unit dies once Enchant Remnant times out. However, one useful situation is using Enchant Remnant on an allied Phoenix Supernova to protect it. If Supernova ends before Enchant Remnant times out, the Egg will stun. If Enchant Remnant times outbeforeSupernova ends, the Egg will jankily sink into the ground and not stun anything. In both situations, the Egg will be untargetable and Phoenix will respawn as expected."

      "During Rolling Boulder, Earth Spirit can only be touched when he's revving up in place. Once he starts moving, he's completely invulnerable to damage and disables.",
      "When killing an Earth Spirit, stand in front of his Rolling Boulder and make him hit you to prevent him from Rolling out of the situation.",
      "Earth Spirit cannot cast Rolling Boulder when rooted or leashed.",
      "Earth Spirit needs a lot of time to recharge Remnants after a team fight. Keep high aggression when playing against an Earth Spirit.",
      "Magnetize deals some substantial amounts of hurt. Don't stand next to your team if you're Magnetized and they're not.",
      "Magnetize can be dispelled."
