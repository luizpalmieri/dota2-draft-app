      "Enfeeble reduces enemy cast range on items in addition to spells.",
      "Brain Sap heals you for the same amount of damage you deal to a target. This means if you Brain Sap an illusion, you heal a ton because of the illusion damage multiplier.",
      "Brain Sap fully pierces debuff immunity/BKB.",
      "No one seems to know how Nightmare works, so let me learn you something. For the first second of the Nightmare the unit is completely invulnerable, similar to Naga Song sleep. If anyone besides Bane right clicks this hero after the first second, the Nightmare will be transferred to them. However, if any damaging spells are used on the hero, they'll instantly wake up, take the damage, and the Nightmare will be dispelled.Bane can damage Nightmared units with spells, items, or attacks without waking them.However, casting Fiend's Grip on an enemy will end Nightmare.Nightmared targets can get hit by Kunkka's Tidebringer splash and still not wake up for some reason.",

      "However, casting Fiend's Grip on an enemy will end Nightmare.",
      "Nightmared targets can get hit by Kunkka's Tidebringer splash and still not wake up for some reason.",
      "You can use the first second of invulnerability on Nightmare to protect yourself or an ally from being affected by any incoming projectiles or damaging/debuffing spells.Debuff immune targets also receive the invulnerability period. So if you Nightmare a BKB'd ally (or enemy), they can even briefly act in a Faceless Void Chronosphere or Enigma Black Hole.",
      "Debuff immune targets also receive the invulnerability period. So if you Nightmare a BKB'd ally (or enemy), they can even briefly act in a Faceless Void Chronosphere or Enigma Black Hole.",
      "If you have an active Nightmare out, you can dispel all other active Nightmares with Nightmare End, including reflected Lotus Nightmares or Rubick Nightmares.",
      "You can cast Nightmare End without interrupting channels, like during Fiend's Grip or TPs. You can even cast Nightmare End while you're stunned.",
      "Towers completely ignore creeps that are Nightmared. Consider Nightmaring an allied creep during a push to keep it alive whenever the enemy team uses Glyph.You can try using Nightmare to save a siege creep that's about to go on a solo mission straight into an enemy tower.",
      "You can try using Nightmare to save a siege creep that's about to go on a solo mission straight into an enemy tower.",
      "Creeps completely ignore Nightmared targets. If an enemy hero is try to cut creep waves, putting them to sleep will get your creeps back on track to the lane.",
      "You can use the \"Sleepwalk\" facet Nightmare to travel up and down cliffs.",
      "Because the \"Sleepwalk\" facet Nightmare turns enemies to face the targeted direction, you could potentially use a Force Staff to reposition them even further.",
      "Targets under the \"Sleepwalk\" facet Nightmare will destroy trees in a small AoE whenever they wake from the Nightmare. You could potentially use this on yourself to break trees to give your wards more vision.Could also be useful against Nature's Prophet's Sprout.",
      "Could also be useful against Nature's Prophet's Sprout.",
      "If an ally walks into the edge of a Faceless Void Chronosphere, you could use the \"Sleepwalk\" facet Nightmare to tug them out.",
      "You can use the \"Sleepwalk\" facet Nightmare to move yourself or allies through an enemy Disruptor's Kinetic Field and break out of Slark's Pounce. To break the Pounce leash, you only need to walk to the edge of the Leash, cast Nightmare forward, and then immediately cancel it. You don't need to wait for the \"leash\" visual to disappear.",
      "Like all other heroes with channeled ults, you can cast Shadow Amulet/Shadow Blade/Glimmer Cape to go invis during the Fiend's Grip channel.",
      "Fiend's Grip provides true sight on the target for the full duration of the channel.",
      "Fiend's Grip can be used to stun couriers, but won't damage them.",
      "Bane has 1200 night vision. This is higher than the typical 800 night vision that most heroes have."

    "counter_tips": [
      "TAKE THE NIGHTMARE OFF YOUR ALLIES.If they're Nightmared out of position, take it off them and slowly migrate the Nightmare to safer territory. To transfer a Nightmare, attempt to deny your Nightmared ally.Whenever Nightmare is transferred, the new target will be slept for the full Nightmare duration again.If you're debuff immune/BKB'd consider taking Nightmare off an ally (or enemy). The Nightmare debuff will be transferred to you, but chances are someone besides Bane will damage you and dispel the Nightmare. What's even better is if an enemy besides Bane tries to right click you, they'll get Nightmared.",

      "Use summons to take the Nightmare off allies or yourself when possible. Beastmaster Boars, Lycan Wolves, Brood Spiderlings, Nature's Prophet Treants, or illusions are all great sacrificial lambs to remove the Nightmare.",
      "Fiend's Grip is no joke as a disable. Save stuns and silences to stop the channel on Bane's ult.Or save strong dispels. Things like Abaddon's Aphotic Shield, Legion Commander's Press the Attack, and Oracle's False Promise can dispel Bane's ult off your allies.",
      "Or save strong dispels. Things like Abaddon's Aphotic Shield, Legion Commander's Press the Attack, and Oracle's False Promise can dispel Bane's ult off your allies.",
      "Disruptor's Glimpse is a long range and convenient way to cancel Fiend's Grip.",
      "Lotus Orb prevents Bane from casting Fiend's Grip on a target without it getting canceled instantly.",
      "Lotus Orb has an interesting interaction with Nightmare. If you attempt to take Nightmare off a target while you have an active Lotus Orb on your hero, the Nightmare will transfer to you andalsoapply a Nightmare to Bane. Most of the time this isn't useful since Bane can end Nightmares and get out of the disable, but if he's in the middle of a Fiend's Grip channel, you could potentially interrupt it using this mechanic.",
      "Rubick is a common counter to Bane since Fiend's Grip is a guaranteed steal, but Nightmare also has an interesting interaction with Rubick. If Bane and Rubick both have a Nightmare out, anyone who casts the Nightmare End sub-spell will endallactive Nightmares."
