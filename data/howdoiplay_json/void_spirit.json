      "Aether Remnant does full damage on creeps. Handy for securing ranged creep last hits.",
      "Aether Remnant's disable is classed as a fear which behaves as a stunanda silence on enemies. For example, Abaddon can't manually activate Borrowed Time if he's disabled by a Remnant.",
      "Aether Remnants provide flying vision over the \"watch range\" and the Remnant itself. Useful for dewarding or finding enemies hiding in trees.With Agh's Shard, the rotating \"watch range\" does not provide any vision and the True Sight is centered around the Remnant itself.",
      "With Agh's Shard, the rotating \"watch range\" does not provide any vision and the True Sight is centered around the Remnant itself.",
      "Aether Remnant can drag heroes up and down cliffs.",
      "Aether Remnant pulls invisible and Smoked enemies. If you place Remnants on top of stairs in the late game, you may be able to detect some sneaky enemy movement.Aether Remnant also provides true sight on targets caught for the pull duration. True sight doesn't work on Smoked enemies, but does work on other invis enemies.",
      "Aether Remnant also provides true sight on targets caught for the pull duration. True sight doesn't work on Smoked enemies, but does work on other invis enemies.",
      "Casting Aether Remnant on an Aegis reincarnation will instantly stun the enemy when they respawn.",
      "Placing a defensive Aether Remnant on top of an important ally during a high ground siege could make it difficult for enemies to initiate on them since the Remnant will instantly catch anyone who may end up Blinking into the AoE.If you're farming in dangerous territory and are worried about getting jumped, set up an Aether Remnant at an angle that won't get triggered by creeps and stand inside it while farming.",
      "If you're farming in dangerous territory and are worried about getting jumped, set up an Aether Remnant at an angle that won't get triggered by creeps and stand inside it while farming.",
      "You can \"chain\" Aether Remnants together and an enemy can't even act inbetween multiple pulls.",
      "You can't really hide Aether Remnants in fog or trees. If any part of the pull AoE is in enemy vision, they'll be able to see the entire Remnant.",
      "There is logic to how Aether Remnant chooses a target when there are multiple units in its AoE. First, it searches in a circle near the tip of the AoE. If there are multiple targets in the tip, it chooses the one furthest away. If there are no targets in the tip, it starts searching from the Remnant's hand outwards, grabbing the first unit possible.",
      "If your teammates have a Force Staff, you can try proposing the idea for them to offensively Force Staff an enemy who is caught by your Aether Remnant. You can pull an enemy pretty far out of position between the Remnant pull and a follow-up Force Staff.",
      "Only allies can see which Dissimilate portal you're targeting, not enemies. Stop randomly dancing around in the circles, you're not juking anyone.",
      "The formation of the Dissimilate portals is determined by putting one portal directly in front of Void Spirit on cast and making the rest fill out the circle.",
      "Your hero is always 'located' in the center Dissimilate portal until the spell ends. You can use this to grab runes or Aegiswhile banishedin the Dissimilate as long as what you're picking up is near the middle of your center portal.",
      "Upon exiting a Dissimilate, your hero will always be facing outwards from the portal you chose.",
      "You can use Dissimilate to travel up and down cliffs.",
      "If you're getting ganked in lane and need some emergency regen, consider activating a Salve or Bottle right before going into Dissimilate. Your hero will continue healing while banished.",
      "Barriers, like the one from Resonant Pulse, will absorb damagebeforeon-damage effects are triggered on your hero. This means that Salves, Clarities, Bottle, Urn, Blink Dagger, and sleeps won't get broken by attacks until the barrier expires.",
      "The barrier provided by Resonant Pulse is weird. Despite being a \"physical\" barrier, it's more like a 100% damage block. It only absorbs damage from right clicks or instant attacks, including attacks from towers. It doesnotabsorb physical damage from spells.",
      "Recasting Agh's Scepter Resonant Pulse stacks the barrier value and refreshes the buff.",
      "With the \"Sanctuary\" facet, Resonant Pulse counts clones, such as Meepos or Arc Warden's Tempest Double, as heroes when calculating the barrier. Illusions are not counted.",
      "Pay attention to the Resonant Pulse visuals when you're hunting an invisible or fogged enemy. If it connects on a hero, you'll see particles coming from their direction.Remember that Aether Remnant can catch and provide true sight on invis enemies, so you can deal a lot of damage to an invisible enemy blindly if you'reluckygood.",
      "Remember that Aether Remnant can catch and provide true sight on invis enemies, so you can deal a lot of damage to an invisible enemy blindly if you'reluckygood.",
      "Astral Step can deal damage to invisible enemies. You'll even see a 'slash' particle over where you hit them.",
      "Astral Step deals aninstant attackto all targets hit. This instant attack ignores disarms, has true strike, and applies attack modifiers (except cleave). If you have an attack modifier with a proc, it'll roll for a chance to proc on each target hit.If you have Echo Sabre, every unit hit by Astral Step will receive the Echo Sabre slow and Sabre won't even go on cooldown.Since Astral Step is an instant attack, it'll break your Smoke if it damages a unit.",
      "If you have Echo Sabre, every unit hit by Astral Step will receive the Echo Sabre slow and Sabre won't even go on cooldown.",
      "Since Astral Step is an instant attack, it'll break your Smoke if it damages a unit.",
      "Astral Step works fully on debuff immune/BKB'd enemies.",
      "Astral Step can kill enemy couriers.",
      "Multiple Astral Steps fully stack. If you need the damage, you can quickly use charges to go in and out on an enemy."

    "counter_tips": [
      "Fears, like from Aether Remnant, can be removed with basic dispels such as putting a Lotus Orb on an ally.",
      "The circles of Dissimilate are accurate to the damage AoEs. If you stand perfectly in the middle of a group of portals, Void Spirit will have to gamble on which one is actually going to hit you.",
      "You can remove the Resonant Pulse barrier off Void Spirit with basic dispels.",
      "The physical barrier provided by Resonant Pulse only works against attacks. Spells that deal physical damage will still hit Void Spirit through the barrier.",
      "Void Spirit cannot cast Dissimilate or Astral Step while rooted/leashed.",
      "Dispelling the Astral Step debuff off your hero will just make the delayed damage trigger immediately."
