      "Many players don't notice that Dazzle's claim to fame is that all of his spells revolve around physical damage. Poison Touch ticks physically, Shadow Wave heals and deals damage physically, and Dazzle's Weave innate is all about mitigating armor values. SUCH SYNERGY.",
      "Poison Touch will only potentially spread to targets in a cone that are within ~500 units of the primary target.",
      "Poison Touch when cast from the Nothl Projection is an extremely effective tool for quickly instagibbing illusions with its hex.",
      "Additional Poison Touch projectiles provided by the \"Poison Bloom\" facet will also proc the Nothl Projection Poison Touch hex.",
      "Be smart about using heals post-Shallow Grave. I'm fine if you Grave someone at 50% HP because at least you're trying. Just don't waste heals on a 1 HP Shallow Graved ally when there are 4 seconds left on the Grave clock. Wait for the ring around them to drop to the ground (that's the visual showing when Shallow Grave ends) and then immediately burst heal them. You're wasting precious healing potential by healing someone who's safe and is going to get that HP burned off during the Grave anyway.",
      "If things are getting chaotic in a fight, know that you can target spells on allies like Shallow Grave by clicking on the allied hero's portrait in the top bar.",
      "For some reason you can Shallow Grave illusions. Mind game potential too strong.You can also Shallow Grave creep-heroes like Lone Druid's Spirit Bear, Visage's Familiars, Warlock's Golem, or Brewmaster's Primal Split Brewlings.",
      "You can also Shallow Grave creep-heroes like Lone Druid's Spirit Bear, Visage's Familiars, Warlock's Golem, or Brewmaster's Primal Split Brewlings.",
      "Shallow Grave to an immediate TP can get you out of nearly every gank situation early game unless you're against some sort of disable heavy Mirana, Shadow Shaman, Lion lane.",
      "Dazzle has a instance of damage around himself when Shadow Wave is cast. When pushing, stand in the middle of enemy creeps to take advantage of this.",
      "You can cast Shadow Wave on couriers, but the spell won't heal them.",
      "Always be on the look out for \"heal bombs.\" If an enemy is standing close to a bunch of your team's units, like lane creeps or summons or illusions, Shadow Wave can potentially deal a ton of damage to them.",
      "You can't directly target allies who are cycloned with Shadow Wave, but a heal can still bounce to them.",
      "Some Nothl Projection mechanics:Functionally, Dazzle's body and the Projection are two separate units. Think of it as if the body is an Arc Warden that's permastunned and the Projection is a Tempest Double.The Projection copies Dazzle's items on spawn. Cooldowns are shared, there's no real trickery possible.Projection item copying also shares a lot of rules with the Tempest Double. For example, the Projection does not copy consumable items, Gem, or Rapier. Basher doesn't work. And any neutral item that has a right click effect with a cooldown won't apply with the Projection.Two exceptions to Tempest Double similarities: The Projection can't use Midas. The Projection can copy and use Refresher Orb.You can cast Eul's Cyclone on Dazzle's body from the Projection.Aura items will stay on your hero and a copy will follow your Projection.The Projection copies Dazzle's HP/mana pool on spawn, but then uses its own pool.The Projection is completely invulnerable. It can't take damage, can't be debuffed, and is untargetable by enemies/allies/self. To give an example of how invulnerable it is, it is completely unaffected by Faceless Void's Chronosphere....\"can't be debuffed\" isn't entirely accurate, though. A few spellsdo affect invulnerable units:Disruptor's Static Storm, Dark Seer's Wall of Replica, and Silencer's Global Silence are a few notable examples.The Projection can receive allied auras and ground targeted buffs.The tether pullback is not a hard limit. The Projection can Blink or move past the limit (like with a TP), but it'll be tugged back faster the further away it is from Dazzle's body. The higher the move speed of the Projection, the more it can resist the pullback.The Projection can walk through trees, but does not have free pathing over cliffs.",
