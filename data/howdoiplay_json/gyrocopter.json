      "You cannot disassemble Midas or Rapier with the Chop Shop innate.",
      "Gyro's Chop Shop innate allows you to sell recipes for full value. You could hypothetically buy recipes before you die and then sell them when you respawn so you don't lose any gold on death. Ideally, you spend an exact amount of unreliable gold's worth of recipes. This is very sweaty and probably not worth your time.",
      "You can use Force Staff on the Homing Missile for some reason.",
      "Flak Cannon hits creeps if you're targeting a tower, but it won't hit the tower if you're attacking creeps.",
      "Activating Flak Cannon gives Gyro bonus night vision for the buff's duration.",
      "Flak Cannon's range is huge, the hard part is just getting vision of nearby camps to hit the creeps. Consider using your courier to get vision of camps in fog to hit with Flak Cannon.",
      "Here's a very situational tip: Do you need to defend high ground but are afraid of getting close to the enemy? Or are you getting kited in team fights and just need to get your Flak attacks off?Consider planting a sentry ward and denying it with Flak Cannon on.It's a cheap and sneaky way to create a nearby primary target to Flak off of.",
      "Each Flak Cannon attack behaves like an independent right click in that they can miss from evasion, land from accuracy, or be reduced by damage block. However, Flak Cannon attacks will not carry item modifiers, only the primary target can be affected by things like crit or Maelstrom.Attacks from the Agh's Scepter Side Gunner, however, can proc item modifiers like lifesteal or Maelstrom.",
      "Attacks from the Agh's Scepter Side Gunner, however, can proc item modifiers like lifesteal or Maelstrom.",
      "Agh's Scepter Side Gunner attacks an additional unit while the Flak Cannon buff is active.",
      "The Side Gunner provided by Gyro's Agh's Scepter will prioritize the furthest enemy unit within its attack range.",
      "Each Call Down missile temporarily provides flying vision around its targeted AoE."

    "counter_tips": [
      "Taking on Gyrocopter 1v1 in the early or mid game is a bad idea. Rocket Barrage deals a ton of magic damage to you if you eat all of it. Get a huddle going with your creeps if Gyro is trying to make a move on you.",
      "You can dispel Rocket Barrage.",
      "Creeps can't kill the Homing Missile. While they draw aggro from it, only tower shots or hero/illusion attacks can damage it.",
      "The Homing Missile can be Hurricane Piked and attacked at max speed.",
      "Homing Missile provides lingering flying vision whenever it connects on a target, so you'll need to move away if you're trying to hide in fog to avoid any Flak Cannon attacks.",
      "Gyro is a ranged hero so Halberd's disarm lasts longer on him.",
      "Agh's Scepter Side Gunner can be disabled by Break, but ignores disarms and Gyro will still passively attack while stunned.",
      "Mars's Bulwark active can redirect Flak Cannon attacks to Mars."
