      "Swarm has a ridiculously long cast range making it a choice spell for scouting Rosh attempts or finding people hiding in the jungle.",
      "Hurricane Pike can be a cute pickup on Weaver since you can Swarm an enemy, Pike them, and still have the bugs keeping vision of your target no matter how far you are.",
      "Swarm bugs draw tower aggro, making it a smart choice to Swarm someone before diving them.",
      "It's extremely easy to time Swarm casts during pushes. Just look at the mirror lane on your side of the map and see where your creeps are. If they're about to get into tower range, cast Swarm.",
      "If you cast Swarm on a siege creep, it will immediately lose interest in the tower it's attacking and aggro your beetle instead.",
      "Swarm bugs work on Rosh.",
      "Like with other invis skills, you can cast Shukuchi while channeling a TP.",
      "If you're chasing someone down, don't break Shukuchi immediately after passing through them. Use the remainder of the bonus speed to walk in front of them before you start attacking.",
      "Practice landing last hits off of the Geminated attack, rather than the initial one. If you're having trouble with the projectile timing, just stand right next to the creep and it'll feel like you have double damage. If you don't need help last hitting, use Geminate procs exclusively for harassing enemies.",
      "Manually casting Geminate Attack on enemy heroes won't draw creep aggro.",
      "Geminate Attack procs on all enemy ward units. This makes Weaver effective against things like Undying's Tombstone, Pugna's Nether Ward, Phoenix's Supernova, Gyrocopter's Homing Missile, or Clockwerk's Power Cogs.",
      "Time Lapsebeforecasting Shukuchi. This is like the biggest mistake beginner Weavers make since they'll quickly realize they got all their HP back, but now their escape spell is on cooldown.That being said, Time Lapsedoeshave a cast time, Shukuchi does not. If you're confident that the enemy has no detection or AoE spells to finish you off, just Shukuchi out.",
      "That being said, Time Lapsedoeshave a cast time, Shukuchi does not. If you're confident that the enemy has no detection or AoE spells to finish you off, just Shukuchi out.",
      "Use Time Lapse liberally in lane. This ain't a Wraith King Reincarnation, Time Lapse only has around a minute cooldown early on.You can even TP back to base, do some quick shopping/pick up a Salve or Clarity, then Time Lapse to come back to the lane.",
      "You can even TP back to base, do some quick shopping/pick up a Salve or Clarity, then Time Lapse to come back to the lane.",
      "Time Lapse HP gain will work even if you're Ancient Apparition Ice Blasted.",
      "Keep in mind that Time Lapse doesn't alwaysaddHP/mana, it just rewinds your values to whatever they were 5 seconds ago even if they were lower than your current amounts.",
      "Time doesn't tick down for Time Lapse even if you're dead. You can Time Lapse the moment you spawn after being dead for 40 seconds and show up to where you were 5 seconds before you died.This ties into the whole 'buyback insta-Time Lapse' tactic. It's a dangerously cheesy strategy, but it works sometimes. If you got bursted down super quick, you may come back to when you had full HP.This rule does not apply to Agh's Scepter Time Lapsing allies. You won't reposition them to where they were before they died. I'm pretty sure this is for anti-griefing purposes.",

      "Time Lapse disjoints projectiles and applies a strong dispel on cast.",
      "Agh's Scepter Time Lapsing an ally won't break their channels. Useful for cheese strats with an Enigma or Witch Doctor, or if you're just trying to save someone who's TPing."

    "counter_tips": [
      "Raindrops can significantly reduce the damage you'll take from Weaver Shukuchis in lane.",
      "Dust of Appearance is extremely effective at dealing with Weaver's Shukuchi invisibility.",
      "Try not to reveal you have a sentry ward in lane. Weavers Shukuchi deeeeep into creep waves whenever they're trying to get the nuke damage, but they won't do that if they know you have detection. Let Weaver get complacent before you try to go for a kill.",
      "Silences and stuns go a long way when when dealing with a squishy, evasive hero like Weaver."
