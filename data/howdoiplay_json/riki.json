      "You can proactively cast Smoke Screen on your team during a tower siege to discourage enemies from Blink initating into the silence AoE.",
      "Agh's Shard Smoke Screen's makes enemies caught in the AoE untargetable by their teammates. For example, a Dazzle wouldn't be able to Shallow Grave a teammate caught in Agh's Shard Smoke Screen. Even debuff immune/BKB'd enemies who are in the Smoke Screen AoE can't be targeted by teammates.Enemies can still self-target spells/items on themselves if they're in Agh's Shard Smoke Screen.",
      "Enemies can still self-target spells/items on themselves if they're in Agh's Shard Smoke Screen.",
      "Smoke Screen can be cast during Tricks of the Trade.",
      "You can Blink Strike to allies as well as enemies.",
      "Blink Strike's slow works on debuff immune/BKB'd enemies.",
      "When farming your jungle, consider using your courier to get vision of the next camp to Blink Strike onto rather than walking around from camp to camp. You can't Blink Strike onto couriers, however.",
      "Tricks of the Trade can hit couriers.",
      "Tricks of the Tradewillwork if you're disarmed.",
      "Tricks of the Trade attacksdo nothave true strike.",
      "Tricks of the Trade can be used to disjoint enemy projectiles.",
      "You still have collision when you're invisible in Cloak and Dagger, so don't bump into the enemies you're stalking.",
      "If you're prowling around a lane that you think might be sentry warded, try intentionally forcing creep aggro while invis by right clicking an enemy hero anywhere on the map. If the creeps aggro you, then they can obviously see you.",
      "It's possible to land your Backstab innate against Rosh constantly. You just need a teammate to path as close as possible to Rosh, aggro him out a bit, and then move in again to become the closest target available to Rosh so he doesn't change aggro to you while you're scratching his back.The Tormentor can't be Backstabbed. It's a cube. You can't Backstab a cube.",
      "The Tormentor can't be Backstabbed. It's a cube. You can't Backstab a cube.",
      "The Backstab damage from your innate can lifesteal, crit, and cleave.",
      "You can remove Dust detection (after you walk out of the AoE) with basic dispels, like from Eul's, Guardian Greaves, Lotus Orb, Disperser, or Manta Style.",
      "Unlike with most other invisibility sources, casting abilities or using items does not break Riki's Cloak and Dagger invisibility. Only attacking will reveal Riki."
    ],
    "counter_tips": [
      "Rikis hate attacking heroes who decide to hold a staring contest rather than run scared. He is practically working with an amplify damage rune from his Backstab innate when your back is turned, so if you think you can last the Smoke Screen's duration, turn around and have a chat with him. Most of your attacks will miss, and you're still going to be silenced, but if backup is coming, fight him. All of this is assuming that you're not playing Bristleback, though.",
      "Good anti-Riki items as a support include pretty much any mid-game support item. Smoke Screen's silence stops you from using spells, not items. Force Staff is the typical pickup, Eul's is good, and Ghost Scepter is good.",
      "Agh's Shard Smoke Screen prevents teammates from targeting whoever is caught in the AoE with spells/items, even if they're debuff immune/BKB'd.",
      "Practice the buddy system. Riki can't really deal with solo-ganking two heroes at the same time.",
      "Riki cannot cast Blink Strike or Tricks of the Trade when rooted/leashed.",
      "Keep your Spidey senses on point. If you notice that your hero is doing some peculiar pathing or stutter stepping for some reason, Riki's probably following you around, gently licking you.",
      "When pushing or Roshing, place a sentry ward in/around/behind your team to make sure Riki isn't hiding and waiting for a big Smoke Screen opportunity.",
      "Dust of Appearance slows invis units. Since the only way Riki can force himself to become visible is by attacking, Dust is usually a huge pain for him to deal with when escaping.",
      "A ground targeted Gleipnir can catch and reveal invisible enemies.",
      "Breaks reveal and remove Riki's Cloak and Dagger invisibility as well as disabling his Backstab innate damage multiplier.",
      "Nyx Assassin's Nyxth Sense innate gives him true sight of invisible enemies near his hero which may catch you unawares while you're Cloak and Daggered."
