      "Lifestealer's Feast innate allows him to deny allied creeps at 75% HP instead of the standard 50%.",
      "Debuff immunity, like from Rage, prevents Tormentor damage from reflecting on you.",
      "Midasing a creep that has Open Wounds on it will heal you.",
      "Infesting applies a basic dispel on your hero, except it is a rare dispel which also dispels buffs in addition to debuffs. For example, if you activate a rune, you're going to lose its buffs when you Infest an ally.",
      "Consider Infesting an ally if they're about to die. You give any Infested target a bunch of HP and move speed. Even if you immediately pop up, you still give them the burst heal of HP.",
      "You can toggle your Armlet while TPing.",
      "Remember to turn on Armlet before picking up Shield or Illusion runes."

    "counter_tips": [
      "OH MASTA, LOOK AT ALL THESE SUPPORTS KITING ME. Ghost Scepter, Force Staff, Blink Dagger, and Shiva's Guard are all great pickups against a Lifestealer. As is a TP scroll if he hasn't gotten a Basher yet.",
      "Every initiator becomes twice as fearsome when Lifestealer is out here Infesting his teammates. Storm Spirit, Clockwerk, Batrider, Io, Spirit Breaker, Nature's Prophet, etc, are all Mk. IV Lifestealer Bombers.",
      "Illusions of Lifestealer don't copy his Feast innate buff stacks. If you click on Lifestealer and he doesn't have a number on his Feast buff, it's an illusion."
