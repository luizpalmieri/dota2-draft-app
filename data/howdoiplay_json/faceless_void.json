      "You're invulnerable when flying in Time Walk. You can use this to run head first into projectiles like Gyrocopter's Homing Missile to negate the stun/damage. If your timing is godlike, you can even use the travel invulnerability to dodge things like the AoE stun from Phoenix's Supernova.",
      "Tread switching is especially important to utilize on Void. Time Walk restores flat HP, so you stand to benefit a lot by switching to INT Treads for the mana and going back to STR/AGI after rewinding damage.",
      "Time Dilation makes Void a very annoying counter for heroes with low cooldown or combo spells like, Timbersaw, Bristleback, Invoker, Lina, Kunkka, Weaver, Queen of Pain, all the Spirit heroes, Terrorblade, Phantom Assassin, and Slark (as long as he doesn't Dark Pact the debuff off first).",
      "Time Dilation debuffs stack if cast again on an enemy who's already Dilated.",
      "Time Lock attacks can proc anything that your normal right clicks do, including another Time Lock.",
      "Basher/Abyssal passive bashes don't work with Faceless Void. The game won't allow you to have another bash besides Time Lock.",
      "Chronosphere reveals invisible units. If an enemy decided to stop fighting you and Shadow Bladed out, cast a Chrono along the path and laugh when you discover them without any sort of detection.Time Zone will also reveal invisible enemies.",
      "Time Zone will also reveal invisible enemies.",
      "Time Zone projectile speed manipulation affects all ranged attack projectiles as well asmostspell projectiles. Some spell projectiles get affected while traveling through the Time Zone, some only get affected if the unit targeted by the spell is within the Time Zone.",
      "Multiple Time Zone casts in the same area have an additive effect with their buffs/debuffs.",
      "Donkeys in the Dota universe have a stronger grip on space and time than most heroes. Chronosphere will not freeze enemy couriers.",
      "Any units owned by you can move around in a Chronosphere, such as illusions."

      "The HP Faceless Void gains from Time Walk can be reduced by debuffs that affect Health Restoration:Items that can reduce health restoration: Spirit Vessel, Orb of Frost/Corrosion, Skadi, Shiva's Guard, and the \"Crippling Crossbow\" and \"Jidi Pollen Bag\" neutral item artifacts.Spells that can reduce health restoration: Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast, Broodmother's Spin Webs with \"Necrotic Webs\" facet, Doom's Doom, Dragon Knight's \"Frost Dragon\" facet, Drow Ranger's Agh's Scepter Hypothermia, anda few others.",

      "Faceless Void cannot Time Walk when rooted.",
      "The Time Dilation debuff can be dispelled.",
      "Eul's is one of the cheapest counters to Chronosphere. You should be able to waste a good 2.5s of Chrono time by Cycloning him if you're outside the Chrono or you can use it on yourself if you're about to be Chrono'd.Wind Waker can also be used to protect an ally in Chrono. However, allies can't move themselves while cycloned. Only a self-cast Wind Waker allows that.",

      "Ghost Scepter can minimize the amount of physical damage you tank in a Chronosphere and later turning it into an Ethereal Blade can help save allies from dying to right clicks in a Chrono.",
      "Void can freely walk through any Chronosphere. Keep this in mind if you're playing Rubick or trying to be tricky in Ability Draft.This means that enemy Void illusions created by Dark Seer's Wall of Replica or Shadow Demon's Disruption can also move around in Chronosphere.",
      "This means that enemy Void illusions created by Dark Seer's Wall of Replica or Shadow Demon's Disruption can also move around in Chronosphere.",
      "Ward units, like Witch Doctor's Death Ward or Shadow Shaman's Mass Serpent Wards, are frozen when inside the Chronosphere. Weaver Swarm bugs will also instantly fall off and Gyrocopter's Homing Missile will explode when it touches the Chronosphere. Techies' Sticky Bomb will just straight up vanish if you cast it into a Chronosphere, however, it can drive into a Chronosphere just fine if you catch a hero on the edge.Zeus's Nimbus is the one exception since it works normally against Chrono. I guess it... floats over the Chrono or something.",

      "Monkey King's Wukong's Command soldiers work in any Chronosphere, allied or enemy.",
      "Despite its appearance, Chronosphere is actually a giant cylinder, not a sphere. You can't pass over it with spells that use the z-axis, like Tiny's Toss. Units will just get stuck on the edge, but in the sky.",
      "Faceless Void's Time Zone move speed slow can be countered by items like Boots of Bearing or Disperser.",
      "Faceless Void's \"Backtrack\" talent can be disabled byBreaks.It cannot be bypassed by accuracy, like from MKB, because it's not evasion. It's just a chance to dodge any type of damage."
