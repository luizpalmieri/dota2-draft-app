      "Your Eelskin innate gives bonus evasion the more of your Naga illusions you're standing near. Each illusion also gains evasion from this innate.",
      "Mirror Image can dispel all the debuffs that a Manta Style would. Besides silences, obviously.",
      "Casting Mirror Image will disjoint projectiles and briefly banish your hero. You can use this banishment period to avoid ground targeted spells.",
      "You can start in INT Treads and swap while in the Mirror Image delay to get your illusions to spawn with AGI treads.",
      "Illusions are not affected by backpack delay, so you don't need to wait the full cooldown to spawn them with a swapped backpack item.",
      "The \"Unified Orders with CTRL\" setting may allow you to micro your illusions a little easier.",
      "If you really want to step up your micro, consider incorporating'cloning'into yourskill repertoire.",
      "Use Mirror Image illusions to stack the jungle, serve as wards, intercept an incoming creep wave, or deny runes throughout the game.",
      "When defending high ground, send your illusions out one by one rather than as a group. Enemies can use AoE spells to take out every illusion in one fell swoop if you send them as a clump. Better yet, don't even let a single illusion stand around and fight the creep wave, just let it keep slithering down the lane while maintaining creep aggro. Force enemies to chase the Image before it shepherds their creep wave all the way back to the river.",
      "Ensnare provides true sight on an enemy if they go invis while netted.",
      "Ensnare can target enemies who are invulnerable, such targets slept by Song of the Siren.Invulnerability also applies to other things, like being able to Ensnare enemies who are cycloned (like from Eul's) or spells that provide invulnerability like a Storm Spirit in Ball Lightning.",
      "Invulnerability also applies to other things, like being able to Ensnare enemies who are cycloned (like from Eul's) or spells that provide invulnerability like a Storm Spirit in Ball Lightning.",
      "Reel In can pull Ensnared enemies over cliffs and through trees.",
      "When chasing a fast enemy with an illusion, consider using a move command on the target as opposed to attacking the target. It'll stick closer to your victim since it won't waste time in attack animations and you can build up Rip Tide stacks with your hero elsewhere on the map.",
      "No matter how many Naga Siren illusions land Rip Tide or Deluge on a target, only one instance is applied.",
      "Don't forget you can cancel Song of the Siren on demand by pressing the spell hotkey again.",
      "Rubick can't steal Song of the Siren from the End subspell. He can only steal it if you don't cast any other spells after starting Song.",
      "Unless you're partied up in a 5 stack, you should probably stick to only using Song of the Siren defensively. There's a strong possibility your team will just rage at you even if a few of their spells whiff and it was their fault.",
      "Supposing youdohave a group of teammates who can take advantage of Song, here are some useful synergies:Dark Seer- Vacuum can reposition sleeping units.Disruptor- Place a Static Storm on enemies to silence them. With Agh's Scepter Static Storm, they'll even be muted immediately after waking up and won't be able to pop BKB.Razor- Song doesn't stop Static Link (but he can't cast a new Static Link on sleeping targets).Undying- Zombies continue to spawn on sleeping enemies.Warlock- Channel a fat Upheaval slow during the Song.Weaver- Swarm bugs can latch on sleeping units, but won't reduce armor.You can apply Veil of Discord's Magic Weakness active to slept units. However, Shiva's Guard's active won't work because the debuff is connected to the damaging component of the active.",

      "You can apply Veil of Discord's Magic Weakness active to slept units. However, Shiva's Guard's active won't work because the debuff is connected to the damaging component of the active.",
      "If an enemy activated a BKB in a team fight and there aren't any huge allied spells being thrown out, you can try to isolate them with Song. Sleep the rest of the team and kill the debuff immune enemy.",
      "Enemy structures are invulnerable during Song, but allied structures aren't.",
      "If you're TPing in to save teammates during a dive, consider starting the Song before you begin channeling your TP.",
      "There aren't many situations in which you want to use every second of your Song. If you catch someone out with it, cancel it as soon as teammates are in position rather than buying the enemy team even more time to save them or letting the enemy hero get their cooldowns back.",
      "Roshan is deaf and Song does not affect him. Sing near Rosh to quickly steal the kill+Aegis from the enemy, or to allow you to finish Rosh without the enemy team causing a ruckus in the pit.",
      "Comboing Song into Meteor Hammer is easier than you'd think. Don't bother timing it manually, just use shift queueing. Activate Song, cast Meteor Hammer, and shift+queue Song End while Hammer is channeling."

    "counter_tips": [
      "Because Mirror Image illusions spawn one \"tick\" after the real Naga emerges from the banish, you can attack+move the ground right underneath the Mirror Image before it ends and you'll always start attacking the real Naga (assuming no other targets are closer to draw your attack+move aggro).This tip also works against heroes generating Manta Style illusions. Attack+move a target before they Manta and you'll start attacking the real hero one tick before Manta illusions spawn.",
      "This tip also works against heroes generating Manta Style illusions. Attack+move a target before they Manta and you'll start attacking the real hero one tick before Manta illusions spawn.",
      "Be wary of activating any sort of debuff immunity (like from BKB) before Naga uses Song, otherwise Naga may just sleep all your teammates while you're fighting debuff immune alone.",
      "Ensnare is dispellable. This makes items like Guardian Greaves, Satanic, Disperser, Eul's, Lotus Orb, or Manta Style useful to have.",
      "Any level of Dagon can instakill illusions. As do spells like Disruptor's Glimpse, Pudge's Meat Hook, Skywrath Mage's Mystic Flare, and any Hex.Brewmaster's Storm Brewling with Dispel Magic deals full damage to all types of illusions.",
      "Brewmaster's Storm Brewling with Dispel Magic deals full damage to all types of illusions.",
      "Enchantress can take control of enemy illusions with Enchant.",
      "The evasion Naga gets from her Eelskin innate can be disabled by Breaks.",
      "If Naga Siren has taken the \"Rip Tide\" facet, killing her illusions slows down her farm twofold since she'll be getting fewer Rip Tide procs."
